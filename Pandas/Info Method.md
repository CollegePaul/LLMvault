### Explanation of Info Method in Pandas

The `info()` method in Pandas is used to get a concise summary of a DataFrame or Series. This includes the index dtype, column dtypes, non-null values, and memory usage. It's a quick way to inspect your dataset for missing values and data types, which are crucial for data cleaning and preprocessing.

Hereâ€™s how you can use it with an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', None, 'Diana'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 22, 19],
    'Score': [88.5, 92.0, None, 76.5]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Using the info method
df.info()
```

When you run this code, `df.info()` will output something like:

```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 4 entries, 0 to 3
Data columns (total 3 columns):
 #   Column  Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------  --------------  -----  
 0   Name    3 non-null      object 
 1   Age     4 non-null      int64  
 2   Score   3 non-null      float64
dtypes: float64(1), int64(1), object(1)
memory usage: 208.0+ bytes
```

This output tells us that the DataFrame has 4 entries (rows). It also provides a count of non-null values for each column and specifies the data type of each column. The `info()` method is particularly useful at the beginning of your analysis to understand the structure of your dataset.

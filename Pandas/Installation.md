## Installation in Pandas

Installing Pandas can be done through several methods, but the most common way is by using `pip`, Python’s package installer. This method is straightforward and works across different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

To install Pandas via pip, you need to open your command line interface (CLI) such as Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux, and then execute the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

Once executed, pip will automatically download and install the latest version of Pandas along with its dependencies.

If you are using a Jupyter Notebook, you can also install Pandas directly from a cell by prefixing the command with an exclamation mark:

```python
!pip install pandas
```

After installation, you can import Pandas into your Python scripts or interactive sessions using the following line of code:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

Here’s a simple example that demonstrates importing Pandas and creating a DataFrame:

```python
# Importing the pandas library
import pandas as pd

# Creating a simple DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Displaying the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This code snippet creates a DataFrame with two columns, `Name` and `Age`, and prints it out.

### Array Transpose in Numpy

Array transposition in NumPy refers to the process of swapping the rows and columns of an array. This operation is particularly useful when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, as it can change the orientation of data without altering its content. The `transpose()` method or the `.T` attribute in NumPy can be used to perform this operation.

For example, consider a 2D array (matrix) where rows represent observations and columns represent features. Transposing this matrix would swap these roles, making it easier to perform certain operations or analyses that require data to be organized differently.

Here's how you can transpose an array using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array (matrix)
original_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                            [4, 5, 6]])

print("Original Matrix:")
print(original_matrix)

# Transposing the matrix using the transpose() method
transposed_matrix_method = original_matrix.transpose()
print("\nTransposed Matrix (using transpose() method):")
print(transposed_matrix_method)

# Transposing the matrix using the .T attribute
transposed_matrix_attribute = original_matrix.T
print("\nTransposed Matrix (using .T attribute):")
print(transposed_matrix_attribute)
```

Output:
```
Original Matrix:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

Transposed Matrix (using transpose() method):
[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]

Transposed Matrix (using .T attribute):
[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]
```

In this example, the original matrix is a 2x3 array. After transposition, it becomes a 3x2 array, with the rows and columns swapped.

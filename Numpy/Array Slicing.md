### Array Slicing in Numpy

Array slicing in NumPy allows you to extract parts of an array using index ranges, similar to Python's list slicing. This technique is powerful for selecting subarrays, rows, columns, or even elements within multi-dimensional arrays.

The basic syntax for slicing a one-dimensional array is `array[start:stop:step]`, where:
- `start` is the index where the slice begins (inclusive).
- `stop` is the index where the slice ends (exclusive).
- `step` is the interval between indices in the slice.

For example, consider the following one-dimensional NumPy array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Slicing from index 2 to 7 with a step of 2
sliced_arr = arr[2:7:2]
print(sliced_arr)  # Output: [2 4 6]
```

In this example, the slice starts at index 2, ends before index 7, and includes every second element.

For multi-dimensional arrays, slicing can be done across each dimension independently. Here's an example with a two-dimensional array:

```python
# Creating a 2D array (3x4 matrix)
matrix = np.array([[10, 11, 12, 13],
                   [14, 15, 16, 17],
                   [18, 19, 20, 21]])

# Slicing rows from index 0 to 2 and columns from index 1 to 3
sub_matrix = matrix[0:2, 1:3]
print(sub_matrix)
# Output:
# [[11 12]
#  [15 16]]
```

In this example, `matrix[0:2, 1:3]` selects the first two rows and the second and third columns.

You can also use slicing to modify parts of an array:

```python
# Modifying elements using slicing
arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr[1:4] = [9, 8, 7]
print(arr)  # Output: [0 9 8 7 4 5]
```

In this example, elements from index 1 to 3 (inclusive of start and exclusive of stop) are replaced with the values `[9, 8, 7]`.

Array slicing is a fundamental operation in NumPy, enabling efficient manipulation and extraction of data.

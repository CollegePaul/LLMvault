### Explanation of Standard Deviation in Numpy

Standard Deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. In other words, it indicates how much individual elements deviate from the mean (average) value of the dataset. A low standard deviation means that most numbers are close to the average, while a high standard deviation suggests that the numbers are more spread out.

In Numpy, you can calculate the standard deviation using the `numpy.std()` function. This function computes the standard deviation along a specified axis of an array. By default, it calculates the standard deviation of the flattened array if no axis is specified. The function also offers parameters like `ddof` (Delta Degrees of Freedom) which adjusts the divisor during the calculation.

Here's how you can use `numpy.std()` in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Standard Deviation of a one-dimensional array
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
std_dev = np.std(data)
print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)  # Output will be approximately 1.414

# Example 2: Standard Deviation along an axis in a two-dimensional array
data_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
std_dev_axis0 = np.std(data_2d, axis=0)
std_dev_axis1 = np.std(data_2d, axis=1)
print("Standard Deviation along axis 0:", std_dev_axis0)  # Output: [1. 1.]
print("Standard Deviation along axis 1:", std_dev_axis1)  # Output: [0.5 0.5]

# Example 3: Standard Deviation with ddof parameter
std_dev_ddof = np.std(data, ddof=1)
print("Standard Deviation with ddof=1:", std_dev_ddof)  # Output will be approximately 1.581
```

In the examples above:
- In Example 1, we calculate the standard deviation of a simple one-dimensional array.
- In Example 2, we compute the standard deviation along different axes of a two-dimensional array.
- In Example 3, we demonstrate the effect of setting `ddof` to 1, which is often used in sample variance calculations.

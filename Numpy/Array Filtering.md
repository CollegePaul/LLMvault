### Array Filtering in Numpy

Array filtering in NumPy allows you to create a boolean mask that can be used to filter or select specific elements from an array based on certain conditions. This process involves creating a boolean array where each element corresponds to whether the respective element in the original array meets the specified condition. You can then use this boolean mask to index the original array, resulting in a new array containing only the elements that meet the condition.

For example, consider you have an array of integers and you want to filter out all numbers greater than 5. Here's how you can achieve this using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Original array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Create a boolean mask where the condition is True for elements greater than 5
mask = arr > 5

# Use the mask to filter the original array
filtered_arr = arr[mask]

print("Original Array:", arr)
print("Filtered Array (elements > 5):", filtered_arr)
```

In this example:
- `arr` is the original NumPy array.
- `mask` is a boolean array where each element indicates whether the corresponding element in `arr` is greater than 5.
- `filtered_arr` is the resulting array containing only elements from `arr` that satisfy the condition specified by `mask`.

This method of filtering can be applied to arrays of any shape and complexity, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. #Array Filtering #Numpy

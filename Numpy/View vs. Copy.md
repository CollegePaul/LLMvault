### Understanding View vs. Copy in Numpy

In NumPy, understanding whether an operation returns a view or a copy of the array is crucial for efficient memory usage and avoiding unintended data modifications.

**Copy**: When you perform operations that create a copy of an array, any changes made to this new array will not affect the original array. A copy of an array can be created using methods like `numpy.copy()` or certain slicing techniques.

**View**: On the other hand, when you obtain a view of an array, it means you have another way of accessing the same data in memory as the original array. Changes made to this view will also reflect in the original array because both refer to the same data.

### Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating the difference between views and copies:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Example of a copy
copy_arr = arr.copy()
print("Original Array:", arr)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]
print("Copy Array:", copy_arr)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]

# Modifying the copy
copy_arr[0] = 99

print("Modified Copy Array:", copy_arr)  # Output: [99 2 3 4 5]
print("Original Array after modifying copy:", arr)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]

# Example of a view
view_arr = arr[::2]  # Slicing with step size, this creates a view
print("View Array:", view_arr)  # Output: [1 3 5]

# Modifying the view
view_arr[0] = 88

print("Modified View Array:", view_arr)  # Output: [88 3 5]
print("Original Array after modifying view:", arr)  # Output: [88 2 3 4 5]
```

In the above examples, changing `copy_arr` does not affect `arr`, confirming it is a copy. However, modifying `view_arr` changes `arr` as well, demonstrating that `view_arr` is indeed a view of `arr`.

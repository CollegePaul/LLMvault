### Understanding Universal Functions (ufuncs) in Numpy

Universal functions, or ufuncs, are functions that operate element-wise on ndarrays. They are implemented internally in C for optimal performance and can handle broadcasting, which allows operations between arrays of different shapes.

Numpy provides a large number of built-in ufuncs that cover arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, bitwise operations, comparison operators, and more. Ufuncs are not only efficient but also simplify code by removing the need for explicit loops in Python.

Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate how a ufunc works:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating two arrays
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Using addition ufunc to add two arrays element-wise
result = np.add(array1, array2)
print(result)  # Output: [5 7 9]

# Using multiplication ufunc to multiply two arrays element-wise
result = np.multiply(array1, array2)
print(result)  # Output: [ 4 10 18]
```

In this example, `np.add` and `np.multiply` are ufuncs that perform addition and multiplication operations on corresponding elements of the input arrays. This is much more efficient than using a loop to iterate over each element and perform the operation.

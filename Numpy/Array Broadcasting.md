### Array Broadcasting in NumPy

Array broadcasting is a powerful feature in NumPy that allows operations on arrays of different shapes to be performed seamlessly. The concept behind broadcasting is to enable element-wise operations between two arrays even if their dimensions do not match, by virtually replicating the smaller array along the necessary axes.

When performing an operation between two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise from right to left and applies certain rules to make them compatible:

1. **Equal Size**: If the dimensions are equal or one of them is 1, they are considered compatible.
2. **Size One**: A dimension with size 1 can be stretched to match another dimension's size.
3. **Incompatible Dimensions**: If none of these conditions are met, broadcasting fails and an error occurs.

Hereâ€™s how it works in practice:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Broadcasting a scalar with an array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = 2
result = a + b  # Result will be [3, 4, 5] because each element of 'a' is added by 'b'

# Example 2: Broadcasting arrays of different dimensions
c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d = np.array([0, 1, 2])
result = c + d  # Result will be [[1, 3, 5], [4, 6, 8]] because 'd' is added row-wise to each row of 'c'

# Example 3: Broadcasting with different shape dimensions
e = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
f = np.array([0, 1])
result = e + f  # Result will be [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]] because 'f' is added column-wise to each row of 'e'

print(result)
```

In the third example, `e` has shape `(3, 1)` and `f` has shape `(2,)`. NumPy broadcasts `f` to a virtual array with shape `(1, 2)`, which is then broadcasted along the rows of `e` to match its shape.

Array broadcasting not only simplifies code but also makes it more efficient since it avoids unnecessary copies of data. #Array Broadcasting #Numpy

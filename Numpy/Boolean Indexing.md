### Boolean Indexing in Numpy

Boolean indexing allows you to select elements from an array using logical conditions. This method creates a boolean array that matches the shape of the original array, where each element is either `True` or `False`, indicating whether the corresponding element meets the condition.

For example, if you have an array and you want to find all the elements greater than a certain value, you can use a logical condition like `array > value`. This will return a boolean array of `True` and `False` values. You can then use this boolean array to index into the original array and retrieve only the elements that satisfy the condition.

Here is an example using Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a sample NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Condition: Find all elements greater than 3
condition = arr > 3

# Use boolean indexing to get the elements that satisfy the condition
result = arr[condition]

print("Original Array:", arr)
print("Boolean Condition:", condition)
print("Result using Boolean Indexing:", result)
```

In this example, `arr > 3` creates a boolean array `[False, False, False, True, True]`. When used to index `arr`, it returns the elements that are greater than 3, which are `[4, 5]`.

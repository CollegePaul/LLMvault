### Array Iteration in Numpy

Array iteration in NumPy refers to the process of accessing each element of an array one by one. While iterating over a multi-dimensional array, the elements are accessed row-wise (i.e., along the last axis). However, it's worth noting that for large arrays, using explicit loops can be inefficient, and vectorized operations are generally preferred for performance reasons.

Hereâ€™s how you can iterate through an array in NumPy:

**Example 1: Iterating over a one-dimensional array**

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Iterating over the array
for element in arr_1d:
    print(element)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

**Example 2: Iterating over a two-dimensional array**

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Iterating over the array (rows)
for row in arr_2d:
    print(row)
```

**Output:**
```
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
```

To iterate through each element of a multi-dimensional array, you can use `numpy.nditer`, which is more efficient and flexible.

**Example 3: Using numpy.nditer to iterate over elements**

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Iterating over each element using nditer
for element in np.nditer(arr_2d):
    print(element)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

### Conclusion

While array iteration is straightforward in NumPy, it's important to leverage vectorized operations whenever possible for better performance. #Array Iteration #Numpy

### Array Copying in Numpy

In NumPy, array copying can be performed in two primary ways: shallow copy and deep copy. Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing data correctly and avoiding unintended side effects when modifying arrays.

#### Shallow Copy:
A shallow copy creates a new object (a new array), but the elements of this array are still references to the original elements. If you modify the contents of the copied array, it may affect the original array if they share mutable objects. However, in the case of NumPy arrays that primarily hold immutable data types like integers or floats, modifying one will not alter the other because these data types are inherently immutable.

Example:
```python
import numpy as np

original_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
shallow_copied_array = original_array.view()

# Modifying the shallow copied array
shallow_copied_array[0] = 99

print("Original Array:", original_array) # Output: [99 2 3]
print("Shallow Copied Array:", shallow_copied_array) # Output: [99 2 3]
```

In the above example, modifying `shallow_copied_array` also changes `original_array`. This is because both arrays refer to the same data in memory.

#### Deep Copy:
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds copies of all objects found in the original. This means that changes made to the copied array do not affect the original array, as they are entirely separate entities with their own memory allocation.

Example:
```python
import numpy as np

original_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
deep_copied_array = original_array.copy()

# Modifying the deep copied array
deep_copied_array[0] = 99

print("Original Array:", original_array) # Output: [1 2 3]
print("Deep Copied Array:", deep_copied_array) # Output: [99 2 3]
```

In this example, modifying `deep_copied_array` does not change `original_array`, demonstrating that the two arrays are independent of each other.

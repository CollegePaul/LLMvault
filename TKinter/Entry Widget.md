### Entry Widget in Tkinter

The Entry widget in Tkinter is used to create single-line text fields where users can enter or modify a short piece of text. It's commonly used for data input, such as usernames, passwords, or search queries. The Entry widget provides basic functionalities like setting and getting the text, disabling or enabling the entry field, and configuring its appearance.

#### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to use the Entry widget in a simple Tkinter application:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def on_submit():
    user_input = entry.get()
    result_label.config(text=f'You entered: {user_input}')

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Entry Widget Example")

# Create an Entry widget
entry = tk.Entry(root)
entry.pack(pady=20)

# Create a Submit button that triggers the on_submit function when clicked
submit_button = tk.Button(root, text="Submit", command=on_submit)
submit_button.pack(pady=10)

# Label to display the result
result_label = tk.Label(root, text="")
result_label.pack(pady=10)

# Start the Tkinter event loop
root.mainloop()
```

In this example:
- We import the `tkinter` module.
- A main window (`root`) is created with a title.
- An Entry widget is added to the window where users can type their input.
- A Submit button is provided that, when clicked, calls the `on_submit` function. This function retrieves the text from the Entry widget and updates a label to display what was entered.

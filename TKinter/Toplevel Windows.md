### Toplevel Windows in Tkinter

In Tkinter, `Toplevel` windows are used to create additional windows or dialogs that can be independent from the main application window. These windows can be modal (blocking interaction with other windows until closed) or non-modal (allowing interaction with other windows). They are useful for creating secondary interfaces, settings dialogs, or pop-up windows.

Creating a `Toplevel` window is straightforward. You simply create an instance of `Toplevel` and then add widgets to it just like you would with the main application window. Here's a simple example:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def open_toplevel():
    top = tk.Toplevel(root)
    top.title("Toplevel Window")
    
    # Adding a label to the Toplevel window
    label = tk.Label(top, text="This is a Toplevel Window!")
    label.pack(pady=20)

# Creating the main application window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Main Application")

# Button to open the Toplevel window
button = tk.Button(root, text="Open Toplevel", command=open_toplevel)
button.pack(pady=20)

# Running the application
root.mainloop()
```

In this example:
- We import the `tkinter` module.
- Define a function `open_toplevel()` that creates a new `Toplevel` window and adds a label to it.
- Create the main application window (`root`) with a button that triggers the `open_toplevel` function when clicked.

When you run this script, clicking the "Open Toplevel" button will create and display a secondary window titled "Toplevel Window" containing a label. This demonstrates how to use `Toplevel` windows in Tkinter for creating additional interfaces. #Toplevel Windows #TKinter #Python

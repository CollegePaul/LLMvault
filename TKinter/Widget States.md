### Understanding Widget States in Tkinter

In Tkinter, widgets can exist in different states that affect their behavior and appearance. The primary widget states are `NORMAL`, `ACTIVE`, and `DISABLED`. These states allow developers to control the interactivity of GUI components based on specific conditions or user actions.

- **NORMAL**: This is the default state for most widgets. In this state, the widget is fully functional and interactive. Users can interact with it by clicking, typing, etc.
  
  ```python
  import tkinter as tk

  root = tk.Tk()
  entry = tk.Entry(root)
  entry.pack()

  # Setting the state to NORMAL (default)
  entry.config(state=tk.NORMAL)
  ```

- **ACTIVE**: This state indicates that a widget is currently being interacted with, such as when a mouse pointer hovers over a button. It can be used in styling to show visual cues, but it's not typically set manually by the developer.

- **DISABLED**: In this state, the widget becomes non-responsive and uninteractive. This means users cannot click on buttons or type into entry fields. The disabled state is useful for preventing user actions during certain operations or when specific conditions are not met.
  
  ```python
  import tkinter as tk

  root = tk.Tk()
  button = tk.Button(root, text="Click Me")
  button.pack()

  # Setting the state to DISABLED
  button.config(state=tk.DISABLED)
  ```

The state of a widget can be toggled dynamically based on application logic, allowing for more flexible and responsive GUIs.

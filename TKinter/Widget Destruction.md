### Widget Destruction in Tkinter

In Tkinter, widget destruction refers to the process of removing widgets from the application window. This can be useful when you want to clean up the interface or dynamically modify it based on user interaction. Widgets can be destroyed using the `destroy()` method. When a widget is destroyed, all its child widgets are also destroyed automatically.

Here's an example demonstrating how to destroy a button in Tkinter:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def destroy_button():
    button.destroy()

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Widget Destruction Example")

# Create a button widget
button = tk.Button(root, text="Click to Destroy Me", command=destroy_button)
button.pack(pady=20)

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
```

In this example, when you click the button labeled "Click to Destroy Me," it calls the `destroy_button` function, which in turn destroys the button using the `destroy()` method. This results in the button disappearing from the window.

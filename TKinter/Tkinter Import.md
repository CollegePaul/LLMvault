### Understanding Tkinter Import in Python

In Python, `tkinter` (often written as `Tkinter` in older Python versions) is the standard GUI toolkit. To use Tkinter, you need to import it into your script. The import statement typically looks like this:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This line imports the `tkinter` module and allows you to reference its classes and functions using the alias `tk`. While you can import `tkinter` without an alias, using `as tk` is a common convention that makes your code cleaner and easier to read.

Here's a simple example of creating a basic window using Tkinter:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main application window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("My First Tkinter Window")

# Set the size of the window
root.geometry("400x300")  # width x height in pixels

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
```

In this example:
- `tk.Tk()` initializes the main application window.
- `root.title` sets the title of the window.
- `root.geometry` sets the dimensions of the window.
- `root.mainloop()` starts the event loop, which waits for user interaction.

Using Tkinter, you can create a wide range of GUI applications with buttons, labels, text fields, and more. It's a powerful tool for building desktop applications in Python.

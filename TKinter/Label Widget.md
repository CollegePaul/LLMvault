### Label Widget in Tkinter

The Label widget in Tkinter is used to display a short or long string of text, or an image. It can be used to provide labels or instructions to the user within your GUI application. Labels are non-interactive, meaning they cannot receive input from the user but serve as visual elements that convey information.

#### Key Features:
- **Text**: You can set the text that will appear on the label.
- **Font**: Customize the font style and size of the text.
- **Background/Foreground Colors**: Set the background and foreground (text) colors.
- **Image**: Display images using labels by associating an image object with the label.

#### Example Code:
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the Label widget in Tkinter:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Label Widget Example")

# Create a Label widget
label1 = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, World!", font=("Arial", 20), fg="blue")
label1.pack(pady=20)

# Another label with an image (assuming you have a file named 'logo.png')
try:
    logo_image = tk.PhotoImage(file='logo.png')
    label2 = tk.Label(root, image=logo_image)
    label2.pack(pady=10)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error loading image:", e)

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
```

In this example:
- We create a main window (`root`) for our application.
- Two `Label` widgets are created. The first displays text "Hello, World!" with specified font and color. The second attempts to display an image stored in 'logo.png'. Note that the image must be in a format supported by Tkinter (like PNG) and you need to handle exceptions if the file is not found.
- `pack()` method is used to add these labels to the window, with some padding around them.

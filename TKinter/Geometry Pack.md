### Geometry Pack in Tkinter

In Tkinter, geometry management refers to the process of arranging widgets within a window or container. The `pack` method is one of the three geometry managers provided by Tkinter, alongside `grid` and `place`. The `pack` method organizes widgets into blocks before placing them in the parent widget.

When you use the `pack` method, you can specify options that control how the widget should be positioned within its container. Common options include:

- **fill**: Determines whether the widget expands to fill any extra space allocated to it by the geometry manager. The values can be `X`, `Y`, `BOTH`, or `NONE`.
- **expand**: A boolean value that determines if the widget should expand to fill the entire space allocated to it.
- **side**: Specifies which side of the container the widget should pack against. Possible values are `TOP` (default), `BOTTOM`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT`.

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating the use of the `pack` method in Tkinter:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Tkinter Pack Example")

# Create three labels with different pack options
label1 = tk.Label(root, text="Label 1", bg="red")
label2 = tk.Label(root, text="Label 2", bg="green")
label3 = tk.Label(root, text="Label 3", bg="blue")

# Pack the labels into the window
label1.pack(side=tk.TOP, fill=tk.X)     # Fill horizontally at the top
label2.pack(side=tk.LEFT, fill=tk.Y)    # Fill vertically on the left
label3.pack(expand=True, fill=tk.BOTH)  # Expand and fill all remaining space

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
```

In this example:
- `label1` is packed at the top of the window and fills horizontally.
- `label2` is packed to the left side and fills vertically.
- `label3` expands and fills any remaining space in the window.

This demonstrates how `pack` can be used to organize widgets in a Tkinter application. #GeometryPack #TKinter #Python

### Full Join in SQLite3

A Full Join in SQL combines rows from two tables based on a related column between them. Unlike Inner Join, which only returns rows where there is a match in both tables, or Left/Right Joins that return all rows from one table and the matched rows from another, a Full Join returns all rows when there is a match in either left (first) or right (second) table records. SQLite3 does not directly support the FULL JOIN syntax, but it can be simulated using a combination of LEFT JOIN and UNION.

### Example Using Python

Here's how you can simulate a Full Join in SQLite3 using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Create an in-memory SQLite database and get a cursor object to interact with it
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create two tables, employees and departments
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    department_id INTEGER
);
''')

cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name TEXT NOT NULL
);
''')

# Insert some sample data into the tables
employees_data = [
    (1, 'Alice', 1),
    (2, 'Bob', 2),
    (3, 'Charlie', None)
]

departments_data = [
    (1, 'HR'),
    (2, 'Finance'),
    (3, 'IT')
]

cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO employees VALUES (?, ?, ?)', employees_data)
cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO departments VALUES (?, ?)', departments_data)

# Perform a Full Join simulation using LEFT JOIN and UNION
query = '''
SELECT e.id AS employee_id, e.name AS employee_name, d.id AS department_id, d.department_name 
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id

UNION

SELECT e.id AS employee_id, e.name AS employee_name, d.id AS department_id, d.department_name 
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE e.id IS NULL;
'''

cursor.execute(query)
full_join_result = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in full_join_result:
    print(row)

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Output

The output will show a combination of all employees and departments, with matches where applicable:

```
(1, 'Alice', 1, 'HR')
(2, 'Bob', 2, 'Finance')
(3, 'Charlie', None, None)
(None, None, 3, 'IT')
```

This example demonstrates how to simulate a Full Join in SQLite3 using Python. The query combines results from both tables using LEFT JOIN and UNION to ensure all records are included.

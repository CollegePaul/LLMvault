### Close Connection in SQLite3

When working with SQLite databases using Python, it's important to manage database connections efficiently. The `close()` method on an SQLite connection object is used to terminate the connection to the database once all operations are completed. This action releases any resources held by the connection and ensures that all changes made during the session are properly committed to the database.

Failing to close a connection can lead to resource leaks, especially if your application creates many connections over time without closing them. It's always good practice to use context managers (`with` statement) when working with SQLite in Python, as they automatically handle opening and closing connections for you. However, when managing connections manually, it is crucial to explicitly close them using the `close()` method.

Here’s an example of how to open a connection to an SQLite database, perform some operations, and then properly close the connection:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to an SQLite database (or create one if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

try:
    # Create a cursor object using the connection
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Execute some SQL commands (e.g., creating a table and inserting data)
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)''')
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice')")
    
    # Commit the changes to the database
    connection.commit()

finally:
    # Ensure that the connection is closed properly
    connection.close()
```

In this example, a connection to an SQLite database named `example.db` is established. A table called `users` is created if it doesn’t already exist, and a new user named 'Alice' is inserted into the table. After committing these changes, the connection is explicitly closed using `connection.close()`.

Alternatively, you can use a context manager to automatically handle closing the connection:

```python
import sqlite3

# Use a context manager to ensure that the connection is properly closed after operations are completed
with sqlite3.connect('example.db') as connection:
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)''')
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Bob')")
    connection.commit()
```

In this version, the `with` statement ensures that `connection.close()` is called automatically when the block of code is exited, even if an error occurs. This is a cleaner and more reliable way to manage database connections.

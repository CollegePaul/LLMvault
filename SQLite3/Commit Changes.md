### Commit Changes in SQLite3

In SQLite3, committing changes refers to the process of saving any modifications made during a transaction to the database. When you execute SQL commands like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, these changes are initially stored in a temporary area. By committing, you ensure that all these changes are permanently written to the database file.

When you connect to an SQLite3 database using Python, transactions are automatically started for you. You can make as many changes as needed within a transaction. However, those changes won’t be visible to other connections or processes until you commit them. If you decide not to save your changes and want to revert back to the state before the transaction began, you can rollback the transaction.

Here’s an example using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object using the cursor method
cursor = conn.cursor()

try:
    # SQL command to insert data into table
    cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe')''')
    
    # Commit the changes
    conn.commit()
    print("Data inserted successfully.")
except sqlite3.Error as e:
    # Rollback in case there is any error
    conn.rollback()
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # Close the connection to the database
    conn.close()
```

In this example, after inserting a new row into the `employees` table, we call `conn.commit()` to save the changes. If an error occurs during the transaction (caught in the except block), we roll back using `conn.rollback()`. Finally, whether or not an exception was raised, we ensure that the database connection is closed.

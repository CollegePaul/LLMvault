### Explanation of Fetch All in SQLite3

In SQLite3, fetching all records from a query result set is a common operation when you want to retrieve multiple rows of data from a database table. The `fetchall()` method is used for this purpose after executing a SQL query with the `execute()` method. When you call `fetchall()`, it returns a list of tuples where each tuple represents a row in the result set.

Here's a simple example using Python to demonstrate how to fetch all records from a SQLite3 database:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to an SQLite database (or create one if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    age INTEGER NOT NULL)''')

# Insert some data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30)")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 25)")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Charlie', 35)")

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Execute a query to retrieve all records from the table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# Fetch all rows of the query result
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Iterate over the rows and print them
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the connection to the database
conn.close()
```

In this example, after inserting data into the `users` table, we execute a `SELECT * FROM users` query to retrieve all records. The `fetchall()` method is then called on the cursor object to get all the rows from the result set, which are printed one by one.

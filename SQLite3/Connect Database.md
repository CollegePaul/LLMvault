### Connecting to a SQLite Database

Connecting to a SQLite database using Python involves several steps. First, ensure that you have the `sqlite3` module available in your environment, as it comes bundled with Python's standard library.

Hereâ€™s how you can connect to a SQLite database:

1. **Importing sqlite3 Module**: Begin by importing the `sqlite3` module.
2. **Creating or Connecting to a Database**: Use `connect()` function from `sqlite3`. This function will create a new database file if it does not exist, or connect to an existing one.
3. **Using the Connection Object**: Once connected, you can use this connection object to interact with the SQLite database by creating cursors and executing SQL commands.

#### Example in Python

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to a SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object using the cursor method
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Use the cursor to execute SQL commands
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    age INTEGER)''')

# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)', ('Alice', 30))

# Commit the changes to the database
connection.commit()

# Query the database
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
print(cursor.fetchall())

# Close the connection
connection.close()
```

In this example:
- We import the `sqlite3` module.
- We connect to a SQLite database named `example.db`.
- A cursor is created which allows us to execute SQL commands through Python code.
- A table named `users` is created with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `age`.
- A new record is inserted into the `users` table.
- Changes are committed to ensure they are saved in the database.
- We fetch and print all records from the `users` table.
- Finally, we close the connection to free up resources.

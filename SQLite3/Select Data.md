### Selecting Data in SQLite3

Selecting data from a database using SQLite involves executing SQL `SELECT` statements to retrieve information stored within the tables. The process generally includes connecting to the database, creating a cursor object to execute queries, and then using the `SELECT` statement to fetch data based on specific criteria.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to select data from an SQLite3 database using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Assume we have a table named 'employees' with columns: id, name, position, salary
# Example SQL query to select all data from the employees table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")

# Fetch all rows from the executed query
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Print each row of the result
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Alternatively, you can fetch only one row at a time using fetchone()
# row = cursor.fetchone()
# print(row)

# Close the connection to clean up
connection.close()
```

In this example:
- `sqlite3.connect('example.db')` establishes a connection to the SQLite database file named `example.db`.
- The `cursor` object is used to execute SQL commands.
- `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")` runs the SQL query that selects all columns from the `employees` table.
- `fetchall()` retrieves all rows of the query result, which are then printed row by row.
- Finally, `connection.close()` closes the database connection.

This example demonstrates a simple way to retrieve data from an SQLite3 database using Python. For more complex queries, you can include conditions in your SQL statements like `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` to filter and sort the results accordingly. #Select Data #SQLite3 #Python

### Transactions in SQLite3

In SQLite3, transactions are used to group SQL statements into a single unit of work that can be treated as atomic. This means that either all the changes made during the transaction are committed (saved) to the database, or none are, if an error occurs. Transactions help ensure data integrity and consistency.

When you begin a transaction in SQLite3, you start a block of code where multiple operations can be executed. If any operation within this block fails, you can roll back all changes made during the transaction, thereby maintaining the previous state of the database. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex operations that involve multiple tables and data modifications.

SQLite3 supports three types of transactions:
- **BEGIN TRANSACTION**: Explicitly starts a new transaction.
- **COMMIT**: Ends the current transaction and makes all changes permanent.
- **ROLLBACK**: Aborts the current transaction and reverts all changes made during the transaction.

### Example using Python

Here is an example demonstrating how to use transactions in SQLite3 with Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to a SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

try:
    # Start a transaction
    conn.execute('BEGIN TRANSACTION;')
    
    # Perform some operations
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 25);")
    conn.execute("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 1;")
    
    # Commit the transaction if all operations are successful
    conn.commit()
except sqlite3.Error as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    # Rollback in case of an error
    conn.rollback()
finally:
    # Close the connection to the database
    conn.close()
```

In this example, a transaction is started using `BEGIN TRANSACTION;`. Two operations are performed: inserting a new user and updating an account balance. If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back, ensuring that no partial changes are made to the database.

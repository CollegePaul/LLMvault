### Explanation of Create Cursor in SQLite3

In SQLite3, a cursor is an object that allows you to execute SQL commands through Python code. It acts as a middleware between your database connection and the SQL query execution. Cursors are used to fetch rows from a result set one at a time or all at once, depending on the method used.

When working with SQLite3 in Python, after establishing a connection to a database using `sqlite3.connect()`, you need to create a cursor object using the `cursor()` method of your connection object. This cursor can then execute SQL queries, fetch data from tables, and manipulate data as needed.

Here is an example demonstrating how to create a cursor, execute a simple query, and fetch results:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object using the connection
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute a SQL command
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    name TEXT NOT NULL)''')

# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice')")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Bob')")

# Commit the changes to the database
connection.commit()

# Execute a SELECT query and fetch all results
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Iterate over rows and print them
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the connection when done
connection.close()
```

In this example, a SQLite3 database named `example.db` is created (if it doesn't exist already), and a table named `users` is created with two columns: `id` and `name`. Data is inserted into the table using SQL `INSERT` commands. The `fetchall()` method of the cursor object retrieves all rows from the result set, which are then printed out.

### Understanding SQLite3 Database Files

In SQLite, data is stored in a single disk file. Unlike other database management systems that require separate files for tables, indexes, or logs, all of the information needed to manage an entire SQLite database is contained within this one file. This makes it extremely easy to move databases between different systems and platforms.

The SQLite database file format includes everything necessary to represent the schema, data, and transactions of the database. It supports multiple tables, indices, triggers, views, and user-defined functions and aggregates.

Here's a simple example using Python to create an SQLite3 database and interact with it:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to an SQLite database (or create one if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                  name TEXT NOT NULL,
                  age INTEGER)''')

# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30)")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 25)")

# Commit the changes to the database
connection.commit()

# Query the database
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the connection when done
connection.close()
```

In this example:
- We connect to an SQLite3 database named `example.db`. If it does not exist, SQLite will create it.
- A table named `users` is created if it doesn't already exist. This table has three columns: `id`, `name`, and `age`.
- Two records are inserted into the `users` table.
- Changes are committed to the database with `connection.commit()`.
- We execute a query to retrieve all rows from the `users` table and print them.
- Finally, we close the connection to the database.

### Max Function in SQLite3

The `MAX()` function in SQLite3 is an aggregate function used to find the maximum value in a set of values. It can be applied to a column to retrieve the highest value present in that column. This function is particularly useful when you need to identify the peak or largest value from a dataset.

For example, if you have a table named `sales` with a column `amount`, using `MAX(amount)` would return the highest sale amount recorded in the table.

Here's how you can use the `MAX()` function in SQLite3 with Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object using the cursor method
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales
             (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, amount REAL)''')

# Insert some data into the table
data_to_insert = [(1, 200.5), (2, 340.75), (3, 190.0)]
cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO sales VALUES (?, ?)', data_to_insert)

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

# Use the MAX() function to find the maximum amount in the sales table
cursor.execute("SELECT MAX(amount) FROM sales")
max_amount = cursor.fetchone()[0]

print(f"The highest sale amount is: {max_amount}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

In this example:
- A SQLite database named `example.db` is created or connected to.
- A table named `sales` is created with columns `id` and `amount`.
- Some sample data is inserted into the `sales` table.
- The `MAX(amount)` function is used in a query to find and print the highest sale amount.

### Fetch One in SQLite3

In SQLite3, "Fetch One" refers to retrieving a single row from the result set of a query. When you execute a SELECT statement using a cursor object, it returns a result set which can be accessed one row at a time or all at once. The `fetchone()` method is used to retrieve the next row in the result set as a tuple. If there are no more rows available, it returns None.

Here's an example using Python and SQLite3:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object using the cursor method
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    position TEXT NOT NULL)''')

# Insert data into table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Software Engineer')")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 'Project Manager')")

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")

# Fetch one row from the result set
row = cursor.fetchone()
print(row)  # Output will be the first row: (1, 'John Doe', 'Software Engineer')

# Fetch another row from the result set
row = cursor.fetchone()
print(row)  # Output will be the second row: (2, 'Jane Smith', 'Project Manager')

# Close the connection to the database
conn.close()
```

In this example, we first connect to an SQLite database and create a table named `employees`. We then insert two rows of data into the table. After committing these changes, we execute a SELECT query to retrieve all rows from the `employees` table. Using the `fetchone()` method, we fetch and print each row one by one until there are no more rows left in the result set.

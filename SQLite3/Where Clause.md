### Explanation of WHERE Clause in SQLite3

The WHERE clause in SQLite3 is used to filter records based on specified conditions. It allows you to retrieve only those rows that meet certain criteria, making your queries more specific and efficient. The condition specified in the WHERE clause can include comparisons using operators like `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, as well as logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT.

For example, if you have a table named `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`, you can use the WHERE clause to select employees earning more than 50,000:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

In Python, when using SQLite3, you can incorporate the WHERE clause in your SQL queries executed through a cursor object. Here's how you might do it:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object using the cursor method
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Assuming 'employees' table is already created and populated
# Execute a query with WHERE clause
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000")

# Fetch all rows from the last executed statement using fetchall()
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the connection to the database
conn.close()
```

In this example, we connect to an SQLite3 database named `example.db`, execute a SELECT query with a WHERE clause to filter employees with a salary greater than 50,000, and print out the filtered results.

### Explanation of Importing SQLite3 in Python

When working with SQLite databases in Python, the `sqlite3` module provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process. To use this module, you need to import it into your Python script. The `sqlite3` module is part of the Python Standard Library, so no additional installation is required.

To import the `sqlite3` module, you simply use the `import` statement as follows:

```python
import sqlite3
```

Once imported, you can create a connection to an SQLite database file (or in-memory database), execute SQL commands through the connection object, and handle the results.

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to import the `sqlite3` module, connect to a database, create a table, insert data into it, and then query the data:

```python
# Import the sqlite3 library
import sqlite3

# Connect to an SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object using the connection
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                    name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    age INTEGER)''')

# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30)")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 25)")

# Commit the changes
connection.commit()

# Query the data
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the rows
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the connection to clean up
connection.close()
```

In this example:
- We import the `sqlite3` module.
- We connect to a database named `example.db`. If it doesn’t exist, SQLite will create it.
- We create a table called `users`.
- We insert two rows into the `users` table.
- We commit the transaction to save changes.
- We execute a query to fetch all rows from the `users` table and print them.
- Finally, we close the connection to release resources.

### Right Join in SQLite3

A Right Join in SQL returns all records from the table on the right side of the join, and the matched records from the table on the left side. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the table on the left.

For example, consider two tables `employees` and `departments`. A Right Join would return all departments and the employees who belong to those departments. Departments with no employees will still appear in the result set, but their corresponding employee fields will be NULL.

Hereâ€™s an example using Python with SQLite3:

```python
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to an SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create sample tables
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    department_id INTEGER
);
''')

cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS departments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);
''')

# Insert some sample data
cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', [
    (1, 'Alice', 1),
    (2, 'Bob', 2)
])

cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO departments (id, name) VALUES (?, ?);', [
    (1, 'HR'),
    (2, 'Engineering'),
    (3, 'Marketing')
])

# Perform a Right Join
cursor.execute('''
SELECT employees.name AS employee_name, departments.name AS department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
''')

# Fetch and print the results
results = cursor.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

In this example, a Right Join is performed between the `employees` and `departments` tables. The result includes all departments along with their corresponding employees. Departments without any employees (like 'Marketing' in this case) will still appear in the output with NULL values for employee names.

### Explanation of Foreign Key in SQLite3

A foreign key in SQLite3 is a column or a set of columns in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It creates a link between the data in two tables, ensuring referential integrity between them. This means that you cannot insert data into a table that has a foreign key constraint unless there is a corresponding value in the referenced primary key column of the other table.

For example, consider two tables: `Customers` and `Orders`. The `Customers` table has columns like `CustomerID`, `Name`, etc., and the `Orders` table includes columns such as `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, `OrderDate`. Here, `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table is a foreign key that references the `CustomerID` column in the `Customers` table. This ensures that every order is associated with an existing customer.

In SQLite3, to enable foreign keys and create such relationships, you need to set the foreign key constraint enforcement on by executing `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`.

### Example using Python

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create tables with a foreign key relationship in SQLite3 using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Enable foreign keys
conn.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;")

# Create Customers table
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Customers (
    CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name TEXT NOT NULL
);
''')

# Create Orders table with a foreign key referencing Customers
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Orders (
    OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INTEGER,
    OrderDate TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
''')

# Insert some data into the Customers table
customers_data = [
    (1, 'Alice'),
    (2, 'Bob')
]
cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, Name) VALUES (?, ?);', customers_data)

# Insert data into Orders table
orders_data = [
    (1, 1, '2023-09-01'),
    (2, 2, '2023-09-02')
]
cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', orders_data)

# Commit changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

This example sets up two tables with a foreign key relationship between them. The `Orders` table's `CustomerID` column is a foreign key referencing the `Customers` table's `CustomerID`. #Foreign Key #SQLite3 #Python

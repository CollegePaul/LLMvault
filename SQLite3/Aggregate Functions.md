### Explanation of Aggregate Functions in SQLite3

Aggregate functions in SQLite3 are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. These functions are typically used in conjunction with the `SELECT` statement and often with the `GROUP BY` clause. Common aggregate functions include:

- **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
- **SUM()**: Calculates the sum of all values in a specific column.
- **AVG()**: Computes the average value of a numeric column.
- **MAX()**: Finds the maximum value in a column.
- **MIN()**: Determines the minimum value in a column.

### Example Usage with Python

Here is an example demonstrating how to use aggregate functions with SQLite3 in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a sample table
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    product TEXT,
    quantity INTEGER,
    price REAL
)
""")

# Insert some data into the table
cursor.executemany("INSERT INTO sales (product, quantity, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", [
    ('Product A', 2, 15.99),
    ('Product B', 5, 4.99),
    ('Product A', 3, 15.99),
    ('Product C', 1, 20.00)
])

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Example of using aggregate functions
cursor.execute("""
SELECT product, 
       SUM(quantity) as total_quantity, 
       AVG(price) as average_price,
       MAX(price) as max_price,
       MIN(price) as min_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
""")

# Fetch and print the results
results = cursor.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(f"Product: {row[0]}, Total Quantity Sold: {row[1]}, Average Price: {row[2]:.2f}, Max Price: {row[3]:.2f}, Min Price: {row[4]:.2f}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

In this example, we first create a SQLite database and a table named `sales`. We then insert some sample data into this table. Using aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`, we calculate various statistics for each product, grouping the results by the product name.

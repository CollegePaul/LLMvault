### Dark Mode Toggle in Website Development

Dark mode toggling is a feature that allows users to switch between light and dark themes on a website. This can enhance readability, reduce eye strain, and provide a more personalized experience. Implementing a dark mode toggle involves HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

#### HTML
The HTML part includes a button that the user will click to toggle the dark mode.

```html
<button id="darkModeToggle">Toggle Dark Mode</button>
```

#### CSS
CSS is used to define styles for both light and dark themes. Typically, these styles are separated into classes or IDs.

```css
/* Default Light Theme */
body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}

/* Dark Theme */
body.dark-mode {
    background-color: #121212;
    color: white;
}
```

#### JavaScript
JavaScript is used to toggle the class on the body element, switching between light and dark themes.

```javascript
document.getElementById('darkModeToggle').addEventListener('click', function() {
    document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
});
```

This code snippet adds an event listener to the button that toggles the `dark-mode` class on the `<body>` element each time it is clicked, thereby switching between light and dark themes.

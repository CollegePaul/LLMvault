### Introduction to Sequences in Mathematics

A sequence in mathematics is an ordered list of numbers (or other objects) where each element is called a term. Sequences can be finite, meaning they have a limited number of terms, or infinite, meaning the terms continue indefinitely.

#### Basic Examples:

1. **Finite Sequence:**
   - Consider the sequence of even numbers less than 10.
     - The sequence would be: $$2, 4, 6, 8$$.
     - Here, each term is an even number and the sequence stops after reaching 8 because there are no even numbers between 8 and 10 that fit our criteria.

2. **Infinite Sequence:**
   - Consider the sequence of natural numbers.
     - The sequence would be: $$1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$$.
     - This sequence continues indefinitely, with each term being one more than the previous term.

Sequences can also follow specific patterns or rules. For example:

- **Arithmetic Sequence:** Each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant, called the common difference, to the preceding term.
  - Example: $$3, 6, 9, 12, \ldots$$. Here, the common difference is 3.

- **Geometric Sequence:** Each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.
  - Example: $$2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots$$. Here, the common ratio is 2.

Understanding sequences is crucial in various fields of mathematics and has applications in computer science, physics, and engineering. #Sequences #Maths

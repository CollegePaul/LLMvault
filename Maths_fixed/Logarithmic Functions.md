### Logarithmic Functions

Logarithmic functions are inverse operations to exponential functions. While exponential functions tell us how many times we need to multiply a number by itself, logarithmic functions ask how many times we would have to multiply the base to get a certain number. The most common bases used in logarithms are 10 and e (Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.71828).

The general form of a logarithmic function is:

$$ \log_b(x) = y $$

This can be rewritten as an exponential equation:

$$ b^y = x $$

Here, $$b$$ is the base, $$x$$ is the argument (the number we are taking the logarithm of), and $$y$$ is the exponent.

#### Basic Example

Consider the equation:

$$ 2^3 = 8 $$

In logarithmic form, this can be written as:

$$ \log_2(8) = 3 $$

This reads "the logarithm base 2 of 8 equals 3," and it tells us that we need to multiply 2 by itself 3 times to get 8.

Another example with a different base is:

$$ 10^2 = 100 $$

In logarithmic form, this becomes:

$$ \log_{10}(100) = 2 $$

This means that 10 must be multiplied by itself 2 times to get 100.

Logarithms are useful in various fields, including computer science, engineering, and physics, where they can simplify complex calculations involving exponential growth or decay. #Logarithmic Functions #Maths

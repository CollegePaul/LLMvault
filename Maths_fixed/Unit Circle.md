### Unit Circle in Mathematics

The Unit Circle is a fundamental concept in trigonometry, used to define the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. It is a circle centered at the origin ($$(0, 0)$$) of a coordinate plane with a radius of one unit.

Imagine you have a right-angled triangle inside this circle, with one vertex at the center of the circle, another on the edge of the circle, and the third on the x-axis or y-axis. The angle formed by the line segment from the origin to the point on the circle (the hypotenuse) and the x-axis is used to define trigonometric ratios.

For any given angle $$\theta$$ measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis:
- The x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle is equal to $$\cos(\theta)$$.
- The y-coordinate of that point is equal to $$\sin(\theta)$$.

For example, consider a 45-degree angle (or $$\pi/4$$ radians). On the unit circle, this angle corresponds to a point ($$\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2$$). Therefore:
- $$\cos(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2$$
- $$\sin(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2$$

Similarly, for 90 degrees (or $$\pi/2$$ radians), the point on the unit circle is $$(0, 1)$$:
- $$\cos(\pi/2) = 0$$
- $$\sin(\pi/2) = 1$$

The unit circle helps visualize how these trigonometric functions change as the angle $$\theta$$ varies from 0 to 360 degrees (or 0 to $$2\pi$$ radians).

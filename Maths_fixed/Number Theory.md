### Introduction to Number Theory

Number Theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of integers and integer-valued functions. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including prime numbers, divisibility, congruences, Diophantine equations, and more. At its core, Number Theory explores the fundamental properties of numbers, such as their relationships with each other and patterns that emerge from them.

#### Basic Examples:

1. **Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are the first few prime numbers.
   
2. **Divisibility**: This concept deals with whether one integer can be divided by another without leaving a remainder. For instance, 10 is divisible by 2 because $$10 \div 2 = 5$$ with no remainder.

3. **Congruences**: Two integers are said to be congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when divided by n. For example, 25 and 13 are congruent modulo 6 because both leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6 (i.e., $$25 \equiv 13 \pmod{6}$$).

4. **Diophantine Equations**: These are polynomial equations with integer coefficients for which integer solutions are sought. A simple example is the equation $$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$, known as a Pythagorean triple, where $$x = 3$$, $$y = 4$$, and $$z = 5$$ is one solution.

Number Theory not only has deep theoretical implications but also practical applications in cryptography, coding theory, and computer science. #NumberTheory #Maths

### Distributions in Mathematics

In mathematics, distributions refer to functions that map test functions to real numbers and can be thought of as generalized functions. However, when people talk about "distributions" in the context of statistics and probability theory, they typically mean probability distributions, which describe how values are distributed across a set of possible outcomes.

#### Probability Distributions

A probability distribution is a function that assigns probabilities to each measurable subset (event) of possible outcomes of an experiment. The most common types include discrete and continuous distributions.

##### Discrete Distributions
These distributions are used for variables that take on distinct, separate values. A classic example is the **binomial distribution**, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials with the same probability of success. For instance, if you flip a fair coin 10 times and want to know how many heads you're likely to get, the binomial distribution can be used.

##### Continuous Distributions
These distributions describe variables that can take on any value within a range. The **normal distribution** (also known as the Gaussian distribution) is one of the most important continuous distributions in statistics. It is symmetric around its mean and is characterized by its bell-shaped curve. A common example involves measuring human heights or IQ scores, where values cluster around an average with fewer extreme values.

The normal distribution's probability density function is given by:
$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$
where $$ \mu $$ is the mean and $$ \sigma $$ is the standard deviation.

### Example

Consider a fair six-sided die. The probability distribution of rolling this die can be described as discrete, with each face (1 through 6) having an equal probability of $$ \frac{1}{6} $$. On the other hand, if you measure the heights of adult males in a city and plot these measurements, the resulting data might follow a normal distribution, with most heights clustering around the average height.

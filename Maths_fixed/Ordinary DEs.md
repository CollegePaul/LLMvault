### Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

In mathematics, an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is an equation that contains one or more functions of one independent variable and its derivatives. The term "ordinary" is used in contrast with the partial differential equations which involve partial derivatives of multiple independent variables.

To put it simply, ODEs describe how a quantity changes with respect to another quantity when only one variable is involved. They are widely used in physics, engineering, biology, economics, and many other fields where understanding rates of change is essential.

#### Basic Examples

1. **Example 1: Simple Harmonic Motion**
   - Equation: $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0$$
   - Here, $$x(t)$$ represents the position of a mass on a spring at time $$t$$ and $$\omega$$ is a constant. This ODE describes how the position changes over time in response to the restoring force provided by the spring.

2. **Example 2: Exponential Growth or Decay**
   - Equation: $$\frac{dy}{dt} = ky$$
   - In this equation, $$y(t)$$ represents the quantity at time $$t$$ and $$k$$ is a constant. This ODE describes how populations grow (when $$k > 0$$) or decay (when $$k < 0$$) over time.

These examples illustrate the basic structure of ODEs: they involve derivatives of a function with respect to an independent variable, and they describe relationships involving rates of change.

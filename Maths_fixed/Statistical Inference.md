### Statistical Inference in Mathematics

Statistical inference is a fundamental aspect of statistics that involves using data from a sample to draw conclusions about a larger population. It encompasses methods for estimating parameters, testing hypotheses, and making predictions based on observed data. The core idea is to infer the properties of an unknown distribution from a sample drawn from it.

#### Basic Examples:

1. **Estimation**: Suppose you want to estimate the average height of all students in a large university. You cannot measure every student, so you take a random sample of 100 students and find their average height is 170 cm. Using statistical inference, you can construct an interval (confidence interval) that likely contains the true average height of all students.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Imagine you are testing whether a new teaching method improves student performance. You randomly divide students into two groups: one group uses the new method, and the other continues with traditional methods. After a term, you compare their test scores. Statistical inference helps determine if any difference in scores is due to the teaching method or just random chance.

These examples illustrate how statistical inference allows us to make informed decisions about populations based on sample data, accounting for uncertainty and variability.

### Sequences in Mathematics

A sequence in mathematics is an ordered list of elements, typically numbers or other mathematical objects, where each element is called a term. The terms are often represented by a variable with a subscript indicating the position in the sequence. For example, $$a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$$ represents a sequence where $$a_n$$ denotes the $$n$$-th term.

Sequences can be finite or infinite:
- **Finite Sequence**: Has a limited number of terms. For instance, $$3, 5, 7, 9$$ is a finite sequence.
- **Infinite Sequence**: Continues indefinitely. An example is $$1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \ldots$$.

### Examples

**Example 1: Arithmetic Sequence**
An arithmetic sequence is one in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. For example, consider the sequence $$2, 5, 8, 11, \ldots$$. Here, each term increases by 3 from the previous one. The general form of an arithmetic sequence can be written as $$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$, where $$d$$ is the common difference.

**Example 2: Geometric Sequence**
A geometric sequence has terms that are obtained by multiplying the preceding term by a constant factor called the common ratio. For example, in the sequence $$4, 12, 36, 108, \ldots$$, each term is three times the previous one. The general form of a geometric sequence is given by $$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$$, where $$r$$ is the common ratio.

### Conclusion
Sequences play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics, including analysis and number theory. They help in modeling real-world phenomena that evolve step-by-step over time or are inherently sequential in nature. #Sequences (Rigorous) #Maths

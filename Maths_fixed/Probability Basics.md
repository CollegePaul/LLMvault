### Probability Basics

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of events occurring. It quantifies uncertainty by assigning a number between 0 and 1 to an event, where 0 indicates that the event will not occur, and 1 indicates that the event will definitely occur.

**Basic Concepts:**

- **Experiment:** Any process or action that can result in different outcomes.
- **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, if you roll a six-sided die, the sample space is $$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$.
- **Event:** A subset of the sample space representing one or more outcomes. For instance, getting an even number on a die roll.
- **Probability of an Event (P(E)):** The measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes in the sample space.

**Basic Examples:**

1. **Coin Toss:** If you toss a fair coin, the probability of getting heads (H) is $$\frac{1}{2}$$, and the probability of getting tails (T) is also $$\frac{1}{2}$$.
   
2. **Dice Roll:** For a six-sided die, the probability of rolling a specific number, say 4, is $$\frac{1}{6}$$ because there is one favorable outcome out of six possible outcomes.

3. **Card Draw:** If you draw one card from a standard deck of 52 cards, the probability of drawing an Ace is $$\frac{4}{52}$$ or $$\frac{1}{13}$$, as there are four Aces in the deck and 52 total cards.

These examples illustrate how probability can be used to predict the likelihood of different outcomes in various scenarios. #Probability Basics #Maths

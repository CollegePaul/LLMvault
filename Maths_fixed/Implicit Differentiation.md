### Implicit Differentiation in Mathematics

Implicit differentiation is a technique used to find the derivative of an equation where the dependent variable (usually y) is not explicitly expressed as a function of the independent variable (usually x). Instead, both variables are mixed together in the same expression. The method involves differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x and then solving for $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$.

#### Basic Example

Consider the equation $$x^2 + y^2 = 25$$.

1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x:
   $$
   \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(25)
   $$
   The derivative of $$x^2$$ is $$2x$$, and since $$y$$ is a function of $$x$$, we use the chain rule to differentiate $$y^2$$:
   $$
   2x + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
   $$
   
2. Solve for $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$:
   $$
   2y\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x
   $$
   $$
   \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}
   $$

This result, $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$$, gives the slope of the tangent line to the circle at any point (x, y).

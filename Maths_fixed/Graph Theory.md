### Introduction to Graph Theory in Mathematics

Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies graphs, which are abstract representations of objects (known as vertices or nodes) connected by links (known as edges). It provides a powerful framework for modeling and solving problems involving networks, from social media connections to transportation systems.

**Basic Concepts:**

1. **Vertices/Nodes:** These are the fundamental units in a graph, often represented as points or circles.
2. **Edges:** Lines or curves that connect pairs of vertices. An edge can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).
3. **Degree of a Vertex:** The number of edges incident to a vertex. In a directed graph, it is divided into in-degree ($$ \text{edges coming in} $$) and out-degree ($$ \text{edges going out} $$).

**Types of Graphs:**

- **Undirected Graphs:** Edges have no direction; the relationship between vertices is mutual.
- **Directed Graphs (Digraphs):** Edges have a specific direction from one vertex to another.

**Basic Examples:**

1. **Social Network Model:** Consider a social network where each person is a vertex and an edge exists between two vertices if they are friends. This forms an undirected graph as friendship is mutual.
2. **Transportation System:** In a city, intersections can be represented as vertices, and roads connecting them as edges. If the direction of travel matters (like one-way streets), it forms a directed graph.

Graph theory is essential in various applications such as computer science, biology, sociology, and engineering due to its ability to model complex systems efficiently.

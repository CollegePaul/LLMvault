### Rational Functions in Mathematics

A rational function is a type of mathematical function that can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomial functions, where the denominator is not zero. In simpler terms, it's any function that can be written in the form:

$$ f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} $$

Here, $$ P(x) $$ and $$ Q(x) $$ are polynomials, with $$ Q(x) \neq 0 $$. The domain of a rational function is all real numbers except those that make the denominator zero.

#### Basic Examples

1. **Simple Rational Function:**

   Consider the function:

   $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $$

   Here, $$ P(x) = 1 $$ and $$ Q(x) = x $$. The domain of this function is all real numbers except $$ x = 0 $$, because division by zero is undefined.

2. **Polynomial in the Numerator:**

   Another example:

   $$ f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x - 4}{x - 1} $$

   In this case, $$ P(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 $$ and $$ Q(x) = x - 1 $$. The domain is all real numbers except $$ x = 1 $$.

3. **Polynomials in Both Numerator and Denominator:**

   Consider:

   $$ f(x) = \frac{2x^2 + 5x - 3}{x^2 - 9} $$

   Here, $$ P(x) = 2x^2 + 5x - 3 $$ and $$ Q(x) = x^2 - 9 $$. The domain excludes the values of $$ x $$ that make $$ Q(x) = 0 $$, i.e., $$ x = 3 $$ and $$ x = -3 $$.

Rational functions can have various features such as vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and holes, depending on the specific polynomials involved. They are important in many areas of mathematics and science due to their ability to model a wide variety of real-world phenomena.

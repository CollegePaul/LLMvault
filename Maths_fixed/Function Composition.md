### Function Composition in Mathematics

Function composition involves combining two or more functions to create a new function where the output of one function becomes the input of another. If we have two functions, $$f$$ and $$g$$, the composition of these functions is denoted as $$(f \circ g)(x)$$. This means that you first apply the function $$g$$ to $$x$$, and then take the result and use it as the input for the function $$f$$.

#### Basic Example:

Let's consider two simple functions:
- $$f(x) = 2x + 3$$
- $$g(x) = x^2$$

To find $$(f \circ g)(x)$$, we first apply $$g(x)$$:
$$ g(x) = x^2 $$

Then, we take this result and use it as the input for $$f(x)$$:
$$ f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = 2(x^2) + 3 = 2x^2 + 3 $$

Thus, the composition $$(f \circ g)(x) = 2x^2 + 3$$.

Similarly, to find $$(g \circ f)(x)$$, we first apply $$f(x)$$:
$$ f(x) = 2x + 3 $$

Then, we take this result and use it as the input for $$g(x)$$:
$$ g(f(x)) = g(2x + 3) = (2x + 3)^2 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 $$

Thus, the composition $$(g \circ f)(x) = 4x^2 + 12x + 9$$.

Note that function composition is not commutative; in general, $$(f \circ g)(x) \neq (g \circ f)(x)$$.

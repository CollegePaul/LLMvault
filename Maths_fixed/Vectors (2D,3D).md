### Vectors in Mathematics

Vectors are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. They are used to represent physical quantities like velocity, force, and acceleration. In mathematics, vectors can be visualized as arrows in space.

#### 2D Vectors
In two-dimensional (2D) space, a vector is typically represented by an ordered pair of numbers $$(x, y)$$, where $$x$$ and $$y$$ are the horizontal and vertical components, respectively. For example, consider a vector $$\mathbf{v} = (3, 4)$$. This vector has a magnitude that can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$ |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $$

The direction of the vector can be described by an angle $$\theta$$ it makes with the positive x-axis, calculated as:

$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 53.13^\circ $$

#### 3D Vectors
In three-dimensional (3D) space, a vector is represented by an ordered triplet of numbers $$(x, y, z)$$, where $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$ are the components in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. For example, consider a vector $$\mathbf{w} = (1, 2, 3)$$. The magnitude of this vector is:

$$ |\mathbf{w}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 9} = \sqrt{14} $$

The direction of the vector can be described using angles with respect to each axis, but it is more complex than in 2D and typically involves spherical coordinates.

### Examples
- **Example of a 2D Vector**: If you walk 3 units east (positive x-direction) and then 4 units north (positive y-direction), the vector representing your displacement is $$(3, 4)$$.
- **Example of a 3D Vector**: If you move 1 unit in the direction of increasing $$x$$, 2 units in the direction of increasing $$y$$, and 3 units in the direction of increasing $$z$$, the vector representing this movement is $$(1, 2, 3)$$.

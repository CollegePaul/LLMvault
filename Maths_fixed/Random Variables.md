### Understanding Random Variables in Mathematics

A random variable is a mathematical concept used to represent numerical values that can take on different values according to some underlying probability distribution. Essentially, it's a function that maps outcomes of random experiments to real numbers.

**Examples:**

1. **Coin Toss:** Consider an experiment where you toss a coin. The possible outcomes are heads (H) or tails (T). If we define a random variable $$X$$ such that:
   - $$X = 1$$ if the outcome is heads,
   - $$X = 0$$ if the outcome is tails.
   
   Here, $$X$$ can take on the values 0 or 1 based on the result of the coin toss.

2. **Rolling a Die:** Another example involves rolling a six-sided die. The possible outcomes are the numbers 1 through 6. We can define a random variable $$Y$$ as:
   - $$Y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$$ or $$6$$ depending on which face of the die lands up.
   
   In this case, $$Y$$ is a discrete random variable that takes one of six possible integer values.

Random variables can be categorized into two main types:
- **Discrete Random Variables:** These are variables that take on countable values. Examples include the number of heads in a series of coin tosses or the sum of numbers rolled on a die.
- **Continuous Random Variables:** These can take on any value within a given range. For instance, the time it takes for a bus to arrive at a bus stop is a continuous random variable.

Understanding random variables is crucial in probability theory and statistics as they provide a way to model uncertainty and variability in data.

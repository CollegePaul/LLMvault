### Polynomial Functions in Mathematics

Polynomial functions are mathematical expressions consisting of variables and coefficients, involving operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. They can be written in the form:

$$ f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 $$

where $$a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_1, a_0$$ are constants (coefficients), and $$x$$ is the variable. The highest power of the variable in a polynomial determines its degree.

#### Basic Examples:

1. **Linear Function:** 
   - Example: $$ f(x) = 2x + 3 $$
   - This is a first-degree polynomial because the highest exponent of $$x$$ is 1.

2. **Quadratic Function:**
   - Example: $$ g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7 $$
   - This is a second-degree polynomial, also known as a quadratic function, with the highest exponent being 2.

3. **Cubic Function:**
   - Example: $$ h(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 5 $$
   - This is a third-degree polynomial, or cubic function, because the highest power of $$x$$ is 3.

Polynomial functions are fundamental in algebra and calculus, used to model various phenomena and solve problems across different fields. They provide a way to express relationships between quantities that can be curved or linear.

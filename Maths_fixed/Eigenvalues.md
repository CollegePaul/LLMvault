### Understanding Eigenvalues in Mathematics

Eigenvalues are a fundamental concept in linear algebra, particularly when dealing with square matrices. An eigenvalue associated with a matrix $$A$$ is a scalar $$\lambda$$ such that there exists a non-zero vector $$v$$ (called an eigenvector) for which the equation $$Av = \lambda v$$ holds true.

In simpler terms, multiplying the matrix $$A$$ by the eigenvector $$v$$ results in a scaled version of the same vector $$v$$, with the scaling factor being the eigenvalue $$\lambda$$.

#### Basic Example

Consider a 2x2 matrix:

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} $$

To find the eigenvalues of this matrix, we solve the characteristic equation $$det(A - \lambda I) = 0$$, where $$I$$ is the identity matrix.

For the given matrix $$A$$:

$$ A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 2-\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & 3-\lambda \end{bmatrix} $$

The determinant of this matrix is:

$$ det(A - \lambda I) = (2-\lambda)(3-\lambda) = 0 $$

Solving for $$\lambda$$, we get the eigenvalues $$\lambda_1 = 2$$ and $$\lambda_2 = 3$$.

#### Finding Eigenvectors

For $$\lambda_1 = 2$$:

$$ (A - 2I)v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}v = 0 $$

This gives us the eigenvector corresponding to $$\lambda_1$$ as $$v_1 = [1, 0]^T$$.

For $$\lambda_2 = 3$$:

$$ (A - 3I)v = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}v = 0 $$

This gives us the eigenvector corresponding to $$\lambda_2$$ as $$v_2 = [0, 1]^T$$.

Eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors play a significant role in many areas of mathematics and engineering, including solving systems of differential equations, analyzing stability in dynamical systems, and performing principal component analysis (PCA) in statistics.

### Introduction to Complex Numbers

Complex numbers are an extension of the real number system that includes a new type of number called imaginary numbers. They are used in various fields such as engineering, physics, and computer science to solve problems that cannot be adequately represented by real numbers alone.

A complex number is generally written in the form $$a + bi$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are real numbers, and $$i$$ is the imaginary unit defined by $$i^2 = -1$$. Here, $$a$$ is called the real part of the complex number, and $$b$$ is called the imaginary part.

#### Basic Examples

- **Example 1:** Consider the complex number $$3 + 4i$$. Here, 3 is the real part, and 4 is the imaginary part.
  
- **Example 2:** The number $$-2 - 5i$$ has a real part of $$-2$$ and an imaginary part of $$-5$$.

- **Example 3:** Even the number $$7$$ can be considered a complex number with a zero imaginary part, written as $$7 + 0i$$. Similarly, $$4i$$ represents a complex number with a real part of 0.

Complex numbers allow us to solve equations that have no solutions in the realm of real numbers. For instance, consider the equation $$x^2 + 1 = 0$$. In the set of real numbers, there is no solution because no real number squared equals $$-1$$. However, in the set of complex numbers, the solution is $$x = i$$ or $$x = -i$$.

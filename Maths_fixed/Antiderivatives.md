### Understanding Antiderivatives in Mathematics

An antiderivative, also known as an indefinite integral, is a function that "undoes" the process of differentiation. In other words, if you have a function $$ f(x) $$. finding its antiderivative involves identifying a function $$ F(x) $$ such that when you differentiate $$ F(x) $$, you get back to $$ f(x) $$. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

$$ F'(x) = f(x) $$

For example, consider the function $$ f(x) = 2x $$. The antiderivative of $$ f(x) = 2x $$ is a function whose derivative is $$ 2x $$. One such function is $$ F(x) = x^2 $$, because:

$$ \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x $$

However, it's important to note that the antiderivative of a function is not unique. Adding any constant to $$ F(x) $$ will still result in a function whose derivative is $$ f(x) $$. For instance, $$ x^2 + C $$, where $$ C $$ is any constant, is also an antiderivative of $$ 2x $$.

### Basic Examples

1. **Example 1:** Find the antiderivative of $$ f(x) = x^3 $$.
   - The derivative of $$ x^n $$ is $$ nx^{n-1} $$. Therefore, to find a function whose derivative is $$ x^3 $$, we look for a function in the form of $$ \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} $$. In this case:
     $$ F(x) = \frac{x^{4}}{4} + C $$
   - Here, $$ C $$ is an arbitrary constant.

2. **Example 2:** Find the antiderivative of $$ f(x) = e^x $$.
   - The derivative of $$ e^x $$ is itself, $$ e^x $$. Therefore:
     $$ F(x) = e^x + C $$

### Conclusion

Antiderivatives are fundamental in calculus and have numerous applications, including solving differential equations, calculating areas under curves, and understanding the behavior of functions. #Antiderivatives #Maths

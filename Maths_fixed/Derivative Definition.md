### Derivative Definition in Mathematics

In mathematics, the derivative of a function measures how the function changes as its input changes. More formally, it is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the change in the input approaches zero. This captures the instantaneous rate of change of the function at any given point.

For a function $$ f(x) $$, the derivative at a point $$ x = a $$ is given by:

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

If this limit exists, it provides the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at the point $$ (a, f(a)) $$.

#### Basic Example

Consider a simple linear function, $$ f(x) = 2x + 3 $$. To find the derivative of $$ f(x) $$, we apply the definition:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{(2(x + h) + 3) - (2x + 3)}{h}
$$

Simplify the expression inside the limit:

$$
= \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{2x + 2h + 3 - 2x - 3}{h} = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{2h}{h} = \lim_{{h \to 0}} 2
$$

As $$ h $$ approaches 0, the limit is simply 2. Thus, the derivative of $$ f(x) = 2x + 3 $$ is:

$$
f'(x) = 2
$$

This means that the slope of the tangent line to the function at any point is 2, indicating a constant rate of change.

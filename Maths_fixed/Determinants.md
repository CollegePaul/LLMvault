### Explanation of Determinants in Mathematics

Determinants are scalar values that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and reflect certain properties of the matrix. They are essential in linear algebra, particularly when dealing with systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and matrix invertibility.

To understand determinants, consider a 2x2 matrix:
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} $$

The determinant of matrix $$A$$, denoted as $$\det(A)$$ or $$|A|$$, is calculated using the formula:
$$ \det(A) = ad - bc $$

For example, if we have:
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix} $$

The determinant would be:
$$ \det(A) = (3)(4) - (2)(1) = 12 - 2 = 10 $$

Determinants can also be computed for larger square matrices, such as 3x3 matrices. For a 3x3 matrix $$B$$:
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} e & f & g \\ h & i & j \\ k & l & m \end{bmatrix} $$

The determinant of $$B$$ is calculated using the formula:
$$ \det(B) = e(im - jl) - f(hm - jk) + g(hl - ik) $$

For instance, if we have:
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 4 & 5 \\ 1 & 0 & 6 \end{bmatrix} $$

The determinant would be:
$$ \det(B) = 1(4*6 - 5*0) - 2(0*6 - 5*1) + 3(0*0 - 4*1) $$
$$ \det(B) = 1(24) - 2(-5) + 3(-4) $$
$$ \det(B) = 24 + 10 - 12 $$
$$ \det(B) = 22 $$

Determinants play a crucial role in solving systems of linear equations, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and determining the invertibility of matrices. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero.

### Introduction to Financial Mathematics

Financial mathematics, often referred to as quantitative finance or mathematical finance, is a field that combines principles from mathematics, statistics, and economics to analyze financial markets and make investment decisions. It involves the use of sophisticated mathematical models to price assets, manage risk, and optimize portfolios.

At its core, financial mathematics relies on several key concepts:
- **Time Value of Money (TVM)**: This principle states that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This is expressed through formulas for interest rates and compounding.
  
- **Probability Theory**: Used to quantify uncertainty and risk, probability theory helps in assessing the likelihood of different financial outcomes. Concepts like expected value, variance, and standard deviation are crucial.

- **Stochastic Processes**: These are mathematical objects representing systems whose behavior evolves over time in a random manner. They are used to model stock prices, interest rates, and other financial instruments.

- **Calculus and Differential Equations**: Used to analyze continuous-time models, calculus is essential for understanding how financial variables change over time and under different conditions.

### Example: Calculating Future Value with Python

To illustrate the concept of Time Value of Money (TVM), let's calculate the future value of an investment using compound interest. The formula for future value \( FV \) is given by:

\[ FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( PV \) is the present value or principal amount.
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Here's how you can calculate it using Python:

```python
def future_value(pv, r, n):
    """
    Calculate the future value of an investment with compound interest.
    
    :param pv: Present value (initial investment)
    :param r: Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
    :param n: Number of years
    :return: Future value
    """
    return pv * (1 + r) ** n

# Example usage:
principal = 1000  # Initial investment of $1000
annual_rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate of 5%
years = 10  # Investment period of 10 years

fv = future_value(principal, annual_rate, years)
print(f"The future value of the investment is: ${fv:.2f}")
```

This script calculates the future value of a $1000 investment at an annual interest rate of 5% over a period of 10 years. The output will show how much the initial investment would grow to by the end of this period.

### Introduction to Mathematical Logic

Mathematical logic is a branch of mathematics that studies formal systems of reasoning. It provides a framework for formulating and validating arguments in a rigorous manner, ensuring that conclusions are logically sound based on given premises. At its core, mathematical logic deals with propositions, logical connectives (such as "and," "or," "not"), quantifiers ("for all," "there exists"), and rules of inference.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Propositions**: Statements that can be either true or false but not both. For example, "2 + 2 = 4" is a proposition.
2. **Logical Connectives**: These are operators used to combine propositions into more complex statements. Common connectives include:
   - **AND (∧)**: Both statements must be true for the compound statement to be true.
   - **OR (∨)**: At least one of the statements must be true for the compound statement to be true.
   - **NOT (¬)**: Inverts the truth value of a proposition.
3. **Quantifiers**: These are symbols used to indicate the quantity of elements in a domain that satisfy a given property.
   - **Universal Quantifier (∀)**: "For all" or "For every".
   - **Existential Quantifier (∃)**: "There exists at least one".

#### Examples and Python Implementation

Here's how some of these concepts can be represented using Python:

```python
# Propositions
p = True  # Statement p is true
q = False # Statement q is false

# Logical Connectives
and_result = p and q    # AND operation: False
or_result = p or q      # OR operation: True
not_p = not p           # NOT operation: False

print(f"AND result: {and_result}")
print(f"OR result: {or_result}")
print(f"NOT p: {not_p}")

# Using quantifiers in a simple example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Universal Quantifier (∀)
all_even = all(num % 2 == 0 for num in numbers)  # Check if all numbers are even
print(f"All numbers are even: {all_even}")

# Existential Quantifier (∃)
exists_odd = any(num % 2 != 0 for num in numbers)  # Check if there exists an odd number
print(f"There exists an odd number: {exists_odd}")
```

In the code above, we use Python's built-in functions `all()` and `any()` to represent universal and existential quantifiers respectively. These functions help us evaluate whether a property holds for all elements or at least one element in a list.

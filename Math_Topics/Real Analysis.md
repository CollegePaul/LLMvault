### Introduction to Real Analysis in Mathematics

Real Analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis dealing with the properties of real numbers and their functions. It provides a rigorous foundation for calculus, focusing on concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and infinite series. The subject aims to understand these concepts not just intuitively but also rigorously, using precise definitions and logical arguments.

#### Key Concepts in Real Analysis:

1. **Limits**: Limits are the fundamental concept of calculus and analysis. They describe how a function behaves as its input approaches some value.
2. **Continuity**: A function is continuous if it can be drawn without lifting a pencil from the paper. Formally, a function \( f \) is continuous at a point \( c \) if for every small number \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a small number \( \delta > 0 \) such that whenever \( |x - c| < \delta \), it follows that \( |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon \).
3. **Differentiation**: Differentiation is the process of finding the rate at which a function changes with respect to its input. The derivative of a function at a point gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.
4. **Integration**: Integration is used to find areas, volumes, central points, and other useful quantities. It is the inverse operation of differentiation.
5. **Series**: A series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. Real analysis studies the convergence properties of series.

#### Example using Python:

Let's use Python to illustrate some basic concepts in real analysis. We will look at how to compute limits, check for continuity, and calculate derivatives using numerical methods.

**Example: Calculating a Limit**

Consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \). The limit of this function as \( x \) approaches 0 is a well-known result in calculus, which is 1. Let's compute it numerically using Python.

```python
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return np.sin(x) / x

# Calculate the value of the function at points close to 0
x_values = np.linspace(0.1, 0.0001, num=10)
f_values = [f(x) for x in x_values]

print("Values of f(x) as x approaches 0:", f_values)
```

**Example: Checking Continuity**

Let's check the continuity of a function at a point. Consider \( g(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \). This function is continuous everywhere except at \( x = 1 \), where it has a removable discontinuity.

```python
def g(x):
    if x == 1:
        return None  # Undefined at x = 1
    else:
        return (x**2 - 1) / (x - 1)

# Check continuity around x = 1
x_values_around_one = np.linspace(0.9, 1.1, num=5)
g_values = [g(x) for x in x_values_around_one]

print("Values of g(x) around x = 1:", g_values)
```

**Example: Numerical Differentiation**

We can approximate the derivative of a function at a point using numerical methods. Let's find the derivative of \( h(x) = x^3 \) at \( x = 2 \).

```python
def h(x):
    return x**3

# Define a small step size for differentiation
h_step = 0.0001
x_point = 2

# Numerical derivative using the forward difference formula
numerical_derivative = (h(x_point + h_step) - h(x_point)) / h_step
print("Numerical derivative of h(x) at x = 2:", numerical_derivative)
```

These examples provide a basic introduction to how some concepts in real analysis can be explored numerically using Python. Real Analysis, however, goes much deeper into the theoretical underpinnings and proofs of these concepts.

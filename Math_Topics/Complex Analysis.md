### Introduction to Complex Analysis in Math

Complex analysis is a branch of mathematics that studies functions of complex numbers. It extends the principles of calculus to the complex plane, providing a powerful toolset for solving problems in various fields such as physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. 

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Complex Numbers**: These are numbers of the form \( z = x + yi \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers, and \( i \) is the imaginary unit with the property that \( i^2 = -1 \).

2. **Complex Plane**: This is a geometric representation of complex numbers where the horizontal axis represents the real part and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part.

3. **Analytic Functions**: A function \( f(z) \) is analytic in a region if it is differentiable at every point in that region. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are necessary conditions for a function to be analytic.

4. **Cauchy's Integral Formula**: This formula allows the computation of integrals of complex functions along closed curves and has profound implications in evaluating definite integrals, particularly those involving trigonometric functions and exponentials.

5. **Residue Theorem**: A fundamental result that relates the value of certain contour integrals to the residues (coefficients of \( \frac{1}{z-a} \) in the Laurent series expansion) of a function at its singularities inside the contour.

#### Example in Python:

Here is a simple example using Python and the `sympy` library to demonstrate differentiation of an analytic function in the complex plane:

```python
from sympy import symbols, I, diff

# Define the complex variable
z = symbols('z')

# Define an analytic function (e.g., f(z) = z^2 + 1)
f_z = z**2 + 1

# Differentiate the function with respect to z
f_prime_z = diff(f_z, z)

print("The derivative of f(z) = z^2 + 1 is:", f_prime_z)
```

In this example, we define a complex variable `z` and an analytic function \( f(z) = z^2 + 1 \). We then compute its derivative with respect to `z`, which yields \( f'(z) = 2z \).

### Introduction to Partial Differential Equations

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are mathematical equations that involve partial derivatives of an unknown function with respect to multiple independent variables. They are used extensively in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics to model phenomena where the rate of change depends on more than one variable.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Independent Variables:** These are the variables with respect to which the derivatives are taken. For example, in a PDE describing heat distribution in a metal plate, time \(t\) and spatial coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) could be independent variables.
   
2. **Dependent Variable:** This is the function that depends on the independent variables. Continuing with the previous example, the temperature at any point on the plate would be the dependent variable.

3. **Partial Derivatives:** These represent the rate of change of the dependent variable with respect to one independent variable while keeping others constant. For instance, \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\) represents how the temperature changes along the \(x\) direction at a fixed time and \(y\)-coordinate.

4. **Order of PDE:** This is determined by the highest order of partial derivatives in the equation. A first-order PDE involves only first derivatives, whereas a second-order PDE includes second derivatives.

5. **Types of PDEs:**
   - **Elliptic PDEs:** These do not involve time derivatives and are often used for steady-state problems. An example is Laplace's equation \(\nabla^2 u = 0\).
   - **Parabolic PDEs:** These include a first-order time derivative and are typically used for diffusion processes like the heat equation \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \nabla^2 u\).
   - **Hyperbolic PDEs:** These involve second-order time derivatives and model wave-like phenomena. An example is the wave equation \(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u\).

#### Example: Solving a Simple PDE with Python

Let's solve the one-dimensional heat equation using numerical methods in Python:

\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \]

where \(u(x, t)\) is the temperature distribution along a rod of length \(L\) at time \(t\), and \(k\) is the thermal diffusivity.

We'll use the finite difference method to approximate the solution:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
L = 10.0          # Length of the rod
T = 2.0           # Total time
nx = 50           # Number of spatial points
nt = 1000         # Number of time steps
dx = L / (nx - 1) # Spatial step size
dt = T / nt       # Time step size
k = 0.02          # Thermal diffusivity

# Initial condition: initial temperature distribution
u = np.linspace(0, L, nx)
u_initial = np.sin(np.pi * u / L)

# Initialize the solution array
u_t = u_initial.copy()

for n in range(nt):
    un = u_t.copy()
    for i in range(1, nx-1):
        u_t[i] = un[i] + k * dt / dx**2 * (un[i+1] - 2*un[i] + un[i-1])

# Plot the final temperature distribution
plt.plot(u, u_t)
plt.title('Temperature Distribution along the Rod')
plt.xlabel('Position along rod')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.show()
```

This code initializes a temperature distribution on a rod and evolves it over time according to the heat equation using finite differences. The result is visualized as a plot of temperature versus position.

### Introduction to Differential Equations in Math

Differential equations are mathematical equations that describe how a quantity changes based on its current value and possibly other factors. They involve derivatives, which represent rates of change. Essentially, differential equations relate the rate of change of an unknown function with respect to one or more independent variables.

There are two main types of differential equations: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). 

- **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** involve functions of a single variable and their derivatives. They describe the behavior of systems that can be modeled as changes in one dimension.
  
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** involve functions of several variables and their partial derivatives. They are used to model phenomena that depend on multiple dimensions, such as heat diffusion or fluid flow.

### Example: Solving a Simple ODE using Python

Let's consider a simple first-order ordinary differential equation:

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = y \]

This equation states that the rate of change of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is equal to \( y \). The solution to this ODE is an exponential function:

\[ y(x) = C e^x \]

where \( C \) is a constant.

To solve this using Python, we can use the `scipy.integrate` module which provides functions for solving differential equations. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ODE function
def model(y, x):
    dydx = y
    return dydx

# Initial condition
y0 = 1

# Range of x values
x = np.linspace(0, 5)

# Solve the ODE
y = odeint(model, y0, x)

# Plot results
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Solution to dy/dx = y')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y(x)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

In this example:
- We define the function `model` that represents our differential equation.
- We specify an initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \).
- We use `odeint` to solve the ODE over a specified range of \( x \).
- Finally, we plot the solution.

This is a basic introduction to differential equations and solving them using Python. Differential equations are fundamental in many fields including physics, engineering, economics, and more.

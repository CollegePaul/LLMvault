### Introduction to Cryptography in Math

Cryptography is an ancient practice that involves creating codes and ciphers to protect information from unauthorized access. It plays a crucial role in modern communications, ensuring data security, privacy, and integrity. At its core, cryptography relies on mathematical principles to encrypt and decrypt messages.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Plaintext**: The original message or data before encryption.
2. **Ciphertext**: The encrypted form of the plaintext, which appears meaningless without the decryption key.
3. **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key.
4. **Decryption**: The reverse process of turning ciphertext back into plaintext with the help of a decryption key.

#### Types of Cryptography:
- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).
  
- **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: Employs a pair of keys, one public and one private. The public key encrypts data, while the private key decrypts it. RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are examples.

#### Example in Python:
Let's take a look at a simple example using Symmetric Key Encryption with the Fernet module from the `cryptography` library.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# Define plaintext message
plaintext = b"Hello, World!"

# Encrypt the plaintext
ciphertext = cipher_suite.encrypt(plaintext)
print("Ciphertext:", ciphertext)

# Decrypt the ciphertext
decrypted_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(ciphertext)
print("Decrypted text:", decrypted_text.decode())
```

In this example:
- We generate a symmetric key using `Fernet.generate_key()`.
- The plaintext "Hello, World!" is encrypted to ciphertext.
- The ciphertext is then decrypted back to its original form.

This simple demonstration illustrates how cryptographic functions are implemented mathematically to secure data. #Cryptography #Maths

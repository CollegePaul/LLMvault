### Introduction to Statistics in Mathematics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It helps us understand complex datasets by summarizing them into meaningful information. The field of statistics can be broadly divided into two categories: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

**Descriptive Statistics:** This involves organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in a clear manner. Common measures used in descriptive statistics include the mean (average), median (middle value), mode (most frequent value), variance (measure of spread), and standard deviation (square root of variance).

**Inferential Statistics:** This branch allows us to make predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a sample from that population. It uses probability theory to determine the likelihood of certain outcomes.

Here's a simple example using Python to demonstrate descriptive statistics:

```python
# Import necessary library
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Calculate mean
mean_value = np.mean(data)

# Calculate median
median_value = np.median(data)

# Calculate mode using scipy for a more complex example with repetition
from scipy import stats
mode_value = stats.mode(data)[0][0]

# Calculate variance
variance_value = np.var(data)

# Calculate standard deviation
std_deviation_value = np.std(data)

print(f"Mean: {mean_value}")
print(f"Median: {median_value}")
print(f"Mode: {mode_value}")
print(f"Variance: {variance_value}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_deviation_value}")
```

This script calculates the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of a simple dataset. These measures help in understanding the central tendency and spread of the data.

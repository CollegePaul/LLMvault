### Datetime Parsing in Python

Datetime parsing involves converting string representations of dates and times into datetime objects that can be manipulated and used within Python programs. This is particularly useful when dealing with data that includes timestamps, allowing for operations like date arithmetic, formatting, and comparison.

In Python, the `datetime` module provides a robust set of functions to handle dates and times. The `strptime` method from the `datetime.datetime` class is commonly used for parsing strings into datetime objects based on specified formats.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a string that represents a date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". You can parse this string into a datetime object using the following code:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Define the date string
date_string = "2023-10-15 14:30:00"

# Define the format of the date string
format_string = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

# Parse the date string into a datetime object
parsed_date = datetime.strptime(date_string, format_string)

print(parsed_date)  # Output: 2023-10-15 14:30:00
```

In this example:
- `%Y` is used for the four-digit year (e.g., 2023).
- `%m` is used for the two-digit month (e.g., 10 for October).
- `%d` is used for the two-digit day of the month (e.g., 15).
- `%H` is used for the two-digit hour in 24-hour time (e.g., 14 for 2 PM).
- `%M` is used for the two-digit minute.
- `%S` is used for the two-digit second.

By using `strptime`, you can easily convert strings into datetime objects, which can then be used for further processing in your Python programs. This method is particularly useful when reading and processing data from files or external sources that include date and time information.

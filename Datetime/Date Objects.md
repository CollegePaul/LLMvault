### Date Objects in Datetime

In Python, the `datetime` module provides classes for manipulating dates and times. One such class is the `date` object, which represents a date (year, month, and day) without any time information. The `date` class can be used to perform various operations related to dates, such as calculating differences between dates, formatting dates into strings, or extracting specific components of a date.

#### Creating Date Objects

To create a `date` object, you use the `date()` constructor from the `datetime` module. This constructor requires three parameters: year, month, and day.

```python
from datetime import date

# Create a date object for January 1, 2023
new_year = date(2023, 1, 1)
print(new_year)  # Output: 2023-01-01
```

#### Extracting Date Components

You can extract the year, month, and day from a `date` object using the corresponding attributes.

```python
# Extract year, month, and day
year = new_year.year
month = new_year.month
day = new_year.day

print(f"Year: {year}, Month: {month}, Day: {day}")
# Output: Year: 2023, Month: 1, Day: 1
```

#### Calculating Differences Between Dates

The difference between two `date` objects can be calculated using subtraction. The result is a `timedelta` object, which represents the difference in days.

```python
from datetime import date

# Create two date objects
first_date = date(2023, 1, 1)
second_date = date(2023, 1, 15)

# Calculate the difference between dates
difference = second_date - first_date
print(difference)  # Output: 14 days, 0:00:00
print(difference.days)  # Output: 14
```

#### Formatting Date Objects

Date objects can be formatted into strings using the `strftime()` method. This method takes a format string that specifies how to display the date.

```python
# Format a date object as a string
formatted_date = new_year.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
print(formatted_date)  # Output: 2023-01-01

# Different formatting options
formatted_date2 = new_year.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
print(formatted_date2)  # Output: January 01, 2023
```

### Summary

The `date` object in the `datetime` module is a powerful tool for handling dates in Python. It allows you to create date objects, extract components, calculate differences, and format dates into strings.

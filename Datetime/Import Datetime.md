### Importing `datetime` from `datetime` in Python

In Python, the `datetime` module provides classes for manipulating dates and times. When you see `from datetime import datetime`, it means you are importing the specific class named `datetime` from within the `datetime` module. This allows you to directly use the `datetime` class without prefixing it with the module name.

For example, if you want to get the current date and time, you can do the following:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current date and time
current_datetime = datetime.now()
print("Current Date and Time:", current_datetime)
```

In this code snippet:
- `from datetime import datetime` imports the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.
- `datetime.now()` is a method of the `datetime` class that returns the current local date and time.

This approach is commonly used for simplicity, especially when you are only using one or two classes from the `datetime` module. #Import Datetime #Datetime #Python

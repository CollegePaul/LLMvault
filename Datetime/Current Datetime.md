### Explanation of Current Datetime in Datetime

The concept of "Current Datetime" within the broader topic of "Datetime" refers to capturing or representing the exact date and time at the moment when the code is executed. In programming, this is often used for logging events, timestamps, or any functionality that requires knowing the precise timing of an action.

In Python, the `datetime` module provides classes and methods to work with dates and times. To get the current datetime, you can use the `datetime.now()` method from the `datetime` class within this module. This method returns a `datetime` object representing the local date and time at which it was called.

#### Example

Here is a simple example in Python that demonstrates how to get the current datetime:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current datetime
current_datetime = datetime.now()

# Print the current datetime
print("Current Date and Time:", current_datetime)
```

When you run this script, it will output something similar to:

```
Current Date and Time: 2023-10-05 14:48:32.694073
```

This output shows the current date and time, down to microseconds.

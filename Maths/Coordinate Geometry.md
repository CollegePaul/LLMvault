### Coordinate Geometry in Mathematics

Coordinate geometry, also known as analytic geometry, combines algebra and geometry through the use of coordinates to describe geometric shapes and figures. It allows us to represent points, lines, curves, and other geometric entities on a coordinate system.

The most common type of coordinate system used is the Cartesian coordinate system, named after Ren√© Descartes. In this system, every point in two-dimensional space is identified by an ordered pair of numbers called coordinates. The first number, or x-coordinate, indicates horizontal distance from a fixed vertical line (the y-axis), and the second number, or y-coordinate, indicates vertical distance from a fixed horizontal line (the x-axis).

#### Basic Example:

Consider a simple example where we plot a few points on a Cartesian coordinate system:
- Point A has coordinates (2, 3). This means it is located 2 units to the right of the origin and 3 units above.
- Point B has coordinates (-1, -4). It is 1 unit to the left of the origin and 4 units below.

To find the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, we can use the distance formula. For instance, the distance \(d\) between point A (2, 3) and point B (-1, -4) is calculated as follows:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{(-1 - 2)^2 + (-4 - 3)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-7)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{9 + 49} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{58} \]

This formula helps us understand the spatial relationship between points in a plane.

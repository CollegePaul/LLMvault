### Function Basics in Mathematics

In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs (often called the domain) and a set of permissible outputs (often called the range), where each input is related to exactly one output. This relationship can be described using various notations such as equations, graphs, tables, or words.

For example, consider the simple function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \). Here, \( x \) represents any number in the domain of the function, and \( f(x) \) is the output produced by the function. If we input \( x = 1 \), then according to the function:
\[ f(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \]
So, when the input is 1, the output is 5.

Another example could be a function that describes the area of a circle given its radius. The formula for the area \( A \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is:
\[ A(r) = \pi r^2 \]
If we input \( r = 2 \), then:
\[ A(2) = \pi (2)^2 = 4\pi \]
So, when the radius is 2, the area of the circle is \( 4\pi \).

Functions are fundamental in mathematics as they help model relationships between variables and are used across various fields including physics, engineering, and economics.

### Unit Circle in Mathematics

The Unit Circle is a fundamental concept in trigonometry, used to define the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. It is a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) of a coordinate plane with a radius of one unit.

Imagine you have a right-angled triangle inside this circle, with one vertex at the center of the circle, another on the edge of the circle, and the third on the x-axis or y-axis. The angle formed by the line segment from the origin to the point on the circle (the hypotenuse) and the x-axis is used to define trigonometric ratios.

For any given angle θ measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis:
- The x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle is equal to cos(θ).
- The y-coordinate of that point is equal to sin(θ).

For example, consider a 45-degree angle (or π/4 radians). On the unit circle, this angle corresponds to a point (√2/2, √2/2). Therefore:
- cos(π/4) = √2/2
- sin(π/4) = √2/2

Similarly, for 90 degrees (or π/2 radians), the point on the unit circle is (0, 1):
- cos(π/2) = 0
- sin(π/2) = 1

The unit circle helps visualize how these trigonometric functions change as the angle θ varies from 0 to 360 degrees (or 0 to 2π radians).

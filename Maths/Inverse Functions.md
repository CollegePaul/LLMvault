### Inverse Functions in Mathematics

Inverse functions are a fundamental concept in mathematics that involve reversing the operation of another function. If a function \( f \) maps an input \( x \) to an output \( y \), then the inverse function \( f^{-1} \) maps the output \( y \) back to the input \( x \). Essentially, applying a function and then its inverse (or vice versa) returns you to your original value.

To determine if two functions are inverses of each other, their composition should result in the identity function. That is, \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \).

#### Basic Examples:

1. **Linear Function Example:**
   Consider the linear function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \). To find its inverse:
   - Start by setting \( y = 2x + 3 \).
   - Solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \): 
     \[
     y = 2x + 3 \\
     y - 3 = 2x \\
     x = \frac{y - 3}{2}
     \]
   Therefore, the inverse function is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2} \).

   To verify:
   \[
   f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\left(\frac{x - 3}{2}\right) = 2\left(\frac{x - 3}{2}\right) + 3 = x - 3 + 3 = x
   \]
   and
   \[
   f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(2x + 3) = \frac{(2x + 3) - 3}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} = x.
   \]

2. **Quadratic Function Example:**
   For a quadratic function, like \( g(x) = x^2 \), finding an inverse is more complicated because the function is not one-to-one over its entire domain (since both positive and negative inputs can produce the same output). However, if we restrict the domain to non-negative numbers (\( x \geq 0 \)), then:
   - Set \( y = x^2 \).
   - Solve for \( x \): 
     \[
     x = \sqrt{y}
     \]
   The inverse function is \( g^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \), but it is only valid for \( x \geq 0 \).

Inverse functions are crucial in various areas of mathematics and science, such as solving equations and understanding the relationship between variables. #InverseFunctions #Maths

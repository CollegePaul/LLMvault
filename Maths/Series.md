### Understanding Series in Mathematics

A series in mathematics is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence of numbers. In simpler words, it's what you get when you add up all the terms in a sequence. Series can be finite or infinite, depending on whether they have a specific number of terms or continue indefinitely.

For example, consider a simple arithmetic sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The series formed by adding these numbers would be:
\[ S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 \]

Calculating the sum gives:
\[ S = 25 \]

This is a finite series because it has a definite number of terms.

An example of an infinite series could be the geometric series: 
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \cdots \]

Here, each term is half the previous one. This series actually converges to a finite sum:
\[ S = 1 \]

Series are fundamental in many areas of mathematics and have applications in fields like physics and engineering for solving complex problems using simpler approximations.

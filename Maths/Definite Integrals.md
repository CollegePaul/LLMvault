### Understanding Definite Integrals in Mathematics

Definite integrals are a fundamental concept in calculus used to calculate the area under a curve between two points, or more generally, to compute quantities that accumulate over an interval. Unlike indefinite integrals, which yield a function, definite integrals result in a specific number. This number represents the net accumulation of a quantity over a given interval.

A definite integral is written as:

\[ \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \]

where \( f(x) \) is the function being integrated, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the limits of integration. The value of the definite integral is the net area between the graph of \( f(x) \), the x-axis, and the vertical lines \( x = a \) and \( x = b \).

#### Basic Example

Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). We want to find the definite integral of this function from 0 to 2. This can be represented as:

\[ \int_{0}^{2} x^2 \, dx \]

To solve this, we first need to find an antiderivative (indefinite integral) of \( f(x) = x^2 \). The antiderivative is:

\[ F(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} + C \]

where \( C \) is the constant of integration. For definite integrals, the constant \( C \) cancels out, so we can ignore it. We then evaluate this antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration:

\[ F(2) - F(0) = \left(\frac{2^3}{3}\right) - \left(\frac{0^3}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{3} \]

So, the definite integral \( \int_{0}^{2} x^2 \, dx \) is equal to \( \frac{8}{3} \).

Definite integrals are crucial in many areas of mathematics and its applications, including physics, engineering, economics, and more. They allow us to calculate various quantities such as area, volume, mass, work, and energy.

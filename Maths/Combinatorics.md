### Introduction to Combinatorics in Mathematics

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on counting, arranging, and studying discrete structures. It involves determining the number of ways to arrange objects or select subsets from a set under various conditions. The field has wide applications in computer science, cryptography, probability, and more.

#### Basic Examples:

1. **Counting Handshakes:**
   Suppose you are at a party with 5 people, including yourself, and everyone shakes hands with each other exactly once. How many handshakes occur? 
   
   To solve this, note that the first person shakes hands with 4 others, the second person has already shaken hands with the first, so they shake hands with 3 remaining people, and so on. This can be calculated using combinations as \( \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10 \). Therefore, there are 10 handshakes.

2. **Arranging Books:**
   If you have 3 distinct books on a shelf, how many different ways can they be arranged? 
   
   This is a permutation problem because the order matters. The number of permutations of 3 items is \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \).

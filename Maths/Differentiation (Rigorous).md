### Differentiation (Rigorous)

In mathematics, differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus that deals with the rate at which functions change. It provides a way to understand how infinitesimal changes in one quantity affect another. The rigorous approach to differentiation involves defining derivatives using limits.

To start with a basic example, consider a function \( f(x) = x^2 \). We want to find the derivative of this function at a point \( x \), denoted as \( f'(x) \).

The definition of the derivative is given by:

\[ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \]

For our specific function, \( f(x) = x^2 \):

\[ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h} \]
\[ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h} \]
\[ = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh + h^2}{h} \]
\[ = \lim_{h \to 0} (2x + h) \]

As \( h \) approaches 0, the expression simplifies to:

\[ f'(x) = 2x \]

This means that for every value of \( x \), the slope of the tangent line to the curve \( y = x^2 \) at the point \( (x, x^2) \) is \( 2x \).

In a more general sense, differentiation involves finding the derivative of a function, which can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change or the slope of the tangent line at any given point on the graph of the function. The rigorous approach ensures that this process is well-defined and mathematically sound, using precise definitions like limits.

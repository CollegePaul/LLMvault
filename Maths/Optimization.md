### Introduction to Optimization in Mathematics

Optimization is a branch of mathematics that focuses on finding the best solution from all feasible solutions. It involves maximizing or minimizing an objective function, subject to certain constraints. In simpler terms, optimization helps us make the most efficient decisions based on given parameters.

#### Basic Examples:

1. **Maximizing Profit**: A company might want to maximize its profit by determining the optimal number of products to manufacture and sell. The objective function could be defined as total revenue minus total costs. Constraints might include budget limits for raw materials, production capacity, and market demand.

2. **Minimizing Costs**: An organization can minimize its operational costs by optimizing logistics. This involves determining the most efficient routes for delivery trucks or minimizing energy consumption in buildings. The objective function here could be the total cost of operations, while constraints might include delivery deadlines and budgetary limits.

3. **Finding Optimal Solutions to Linear Equations**: Consider a simple linear programming problem where a factory produces two types of products, X and Y. Each product requires different amounts of labor hours and raw materials. The goal is to determine how many units of each product should be produced to maximize profit, given the constraints on available resources.

   - **Objective Function**: Maximize Profit = 3X + 5Y
   - **Constraints**:
     - Labor hours: 2X + 4Y ≤ 100
     - Raw materials: X + Y ≤ 50
     - Non-negativity: X ≥ 0, Y ≥ 0

By solving this optimization problem, one can find the optimal number of units for products X and Y that maximize profit without violating any constraints.

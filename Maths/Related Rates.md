### Understanding Related Rates in Mathematics

In mathematics, related rates problems involve finding the rate at which one quantity changes by relating it to the rate at which another quantity changes. These problems typically deal with functions of two or more variables that are changing over time, and they require us to use differentiation techniques, particularly implicit differentiation.

For example, consider a balloon being inflated. As air is pumped into the balloon, both its volume and radius increase over time. If we know how fast the volume of the balloon is increasing, we can determine how fast the radius is increasing at any given moment. Here's how we might approach this problem:

1. **Identify Variables**: Let \( V \) represent the volume of the balloon, and let \( r \) be the radius of the balloon.
2. **Establish Relationship**: The relationship between the volume \( V \) and the radius \( r \) for a sphere is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]
3. **Differentiate with Respect to Time**: To find how fast the radius is changing, we need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time \( t \):
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}
   \]
4. **Substitute Known Values**: Suppose that at a certain moment, the volume is increasing at a rate of 10 cubic centimeters per second (\( \frac{dV}{dt} = 10 \)) and the radius is 5 centimeters (\( r = 5 \)). We can substitute these values into the differentiated equation:
   \[
   10 = 4\pi (5)^2 \frac{dr}{dt}
   \]
5. **Solve for Desired Rate**: Solving for \( \frac{dr}{dt} \):
   \[
   10 = 100\pi \frac{dr}{dt} \implies \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{1}{10\pi}
   \]
   This means the radius is increasing at a rate of \( \frac{1}{10\pi} \) centimeters per second.

This example illustrates how related rates problems can be solved by setting up and differentiating an equation that relates two or more changing quantities. #RelatedRates #Maths

### Introduction to Linear Systems in Mathematics

A linear system in mathematics refers to a set of linear equations involving the same variables. These systems are fundamental in various fields such as algebra, calculus, physics, engineering, and economics. The term "linear" indicates that each equation is of the first degree, meaning that the highest power of any variable in the equations is one.

#### Basic Concepts

1. **Linear Equation**: A linear equation in two variables \( x \) and \( y \) can be written as:
   \[
   ax + by = c
   \]
   where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are constants, and \( a \) and \( b \) are not both zero. For example, the equation \( 2x + 3y = 6 \) is a linear equation.

2. **Linear System**: A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations with the same variables. For example:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 5 \\
   2x - y &= 1
   \end{align*}
   \]
   This is a simple system of two linear equations in two variables \( x \) and \( y \).

3. **Solution to a Linear System**: A solution to a linear system is a set of values for the variables that satisfy all the equations in the system simultaneously. For example, \( (x, y) = (2, 3) \) is a solution to the above system because it satisfies both equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   2 + 3 &= 5 \\
   2(2) - 3 &= 1
   \end{align*}
   \]

4. **Methods of Solving Linear Systems**: There are several methods to solve linear systems, including substitution, elimination, and matrix operations (such as Gaussian elimination).

#### Example

Consider the following system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 7 \\
3x - y &= 4
\end{align*}
\]

**Using Substitution Method:**

1. Solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other. From the first equation:
   \[
   x = 7 - 2y
   \]
2. Substitute this expression into the second equation:
   \[
   3(7 - 2y) - y = 4
   \]
3. Simplify and solve for \( y \):
   \[
   21 - 6y - y = 4 \\
   21 - 7y = 4 \\
   17 = 7y \\
   y = \frac{17}{7}
   \]
4. Substitute \( y = \frac{17}{7} \) back into the expression for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 7 - 2\left(\frac{17}{7}\right) \\
   x = 7 - \frac{34}{7} \\
   x = \frac{49}{7} - \frac{34}{7} \\
   x = \frac{15}{7}
   \]
So, the solution to the system is \( (x, y) = \left(\frac{15}{7}, \frac{17}{7}\right) \).

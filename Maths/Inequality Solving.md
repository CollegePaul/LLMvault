### Inequality Solving in Mathematics

Inequality solving involves finding the values of variables that satisfy given conditions expressed as inequalities rather than equalities. These conditions use symbols like < (less than), > (greater than), ≤ (less than or equal to), and ≥ (greater than or equal to).

For example, consider the inequality \( x + 3 > 5 \). To solve this inequality, you isolate the variable \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality. This results in:
\[ x > 2 \]

This means that any value of \( x \) greater than 2 satisfies the original inequality.

Another example is solving the inequality \( 2x - 4 ≤ 6 \). First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 2x ≤ 10 \]
Then, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x ≤ 5 \]

In this case, any value of \( x \) that is less than or equal to 5 satisfies the inequality.

Inequality solving is crucial in many areas of mathematics and real-world applications, such as optimization problems, budgeting, and setting constraints for variables. #InequalitySolving #Maths

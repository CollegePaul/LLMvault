### Differentiation Rules in Mathematics

Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus that involves finding the derivative of a function. Derivatives provide information about the rate of change of functions, which can be crucial in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. Here are some basic differentiation rules along with examples to illustrate each:

1. **Power Rule**: If \( f(x) = x^n \), then \( f'(x) = nx^{n-1} \).
   - Example: For \( f(x) = x^3 \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = 3x^2 \).

2. **Constant Rule**: The derivative of a constant function, \( f(x) = c \), is zero.
   - Example: If \( f(x) = 5 \), then \( f'(x) = 0 \).

3. **Sum and Difference Rules**: The derivative of the sum or difference of two functions is the sum or difference of their derivatives.
   - Example: For \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 7 \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = 2x + 3 \).

4. **Constant Multiple Rule**: The derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.
   - Example: If \( f(x) = 4x^5 \), then \( f'(x) = 20x^4 \).

5. **Product Rule**: For two functions multiplied together, \( f(x)g(x) \), the derivative is given by \( f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x) \).
   - Example: For \( f(x) = x^2 \cdot e^x \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = 2xe^x + x^2e^x \).

6. **Quotient Rule**: For a function expressed as a quotient, \( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \), the derivative is given by \( \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{(g(x))^2} \).
   - Example: If \( f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x+1} \), then \( f'(x) = \frac{2x(x+1) - x^2}{(x+1)^2} = \frac{x^2 + 2x}{(x+1)^2} \).

7. **Chain Rule**: For a composite function, \( f(g(x)) \), the derivative is given by \( f'(g(x))g'(x) \).
   - Example: If \( f(x) = (3x + 5)^4 \), then \( f'(x) = 12(3x+5)^3 \cdot 3 = 36(3x+5)^3 \).

These rules are essential for differentiating complex functions and understanding their behavior. #Differentiation Rules #Maths

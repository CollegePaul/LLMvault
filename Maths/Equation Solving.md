### Equation Solving in Mathematics

Equation solving is a fundamental aspect of mathematics that involves finding the values of variables that satisfy given equations. An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, which are connected by an equals sign (=). The goal in solving an equation is to determine what value or values make the equation true.

#### Basic Examples

1. **Linear Equation:**
   Consider the simple linear equation:
   \[
   x + 3 = 7
   \]
   To solve for \(x\), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3 \\
   x = 4
   \]
   Thus, \(x = 4\) is the solution.

2. **Quadratic Equation:**
   A quadratic equation takes the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For example:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
   \]
   This can be factored as:
   \[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 2 \\
   x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3
   \]

#### Conclusion

Equation solving is a critical skill in mathematics, used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics to model and solve real-world problems. Understanding how to solve different types of equations is essential for advancing mathematical knowledge.

### Introduction to Partial Derivatives

In mathematics, particularly in calculus, partial derivatives are used when dealing with functions that have more than one variable. A partial derivative of a function is its rate of change with respect to one of those variables while all other variables are held constant. Essentially, it measures how much the output of a function changes if we make a small change in one of its inputs, treating all other inputs as constants.

To illustrate this concept, consider a simple example involving a function that depends on two variables, say \( f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \).

**Example 1:**

- To find the partial derivative with respect to \(x\), we treat \(y\) as a constant and differentiate the function with respect to \(x\):
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x + 3y \]
This tells us how the function changes if only \(x\) is varied, keeping \(y\) fixed.

- Similarly, to find the partial derivative with respect to \(y\), we treat \(x\) as a constant and differentiate the function with respect to \(y\):
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3x + 2y \]
This indicates how the function changes if only \(y\) is varied, keeping \(x\) fixed.

Partial derivatives are crucial in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics where functions often depend on multiple variables. They allow us to understand the impact of each variable independently and can be used in optimization problems, among others.

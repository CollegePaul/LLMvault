### Introduction to Trigonometric Integrals

Trigonometric integrals involve integrating functions that are products or powers of trigonometric functions. These types of integrals appear frequently in calculus, physics, and engineering problems due to the periodic nature of trigonometric functions. Solving these integrals often requires specific techniques such as substitution, integration by parts, or using trigonometric identities.

#### Basic Examples

1. **Integral of sin(x) dx:**
   \[
   \int \sin(x) \, dx = -\cos(x) + C
   \]
   This is one of the most basic integrals involving sine. The integral of \(\sin(x)\) is \(-\cos(x)\), plus a constant \(C\) which represents the family of antiderivatives.

2. **Integral of cos(x) dx:**
   \[
   \int \cos(x) \, dx = \sin(x) + C
   \]
   Similarly, the integral of \(\cos(x)\) is \(\sin(x)\), plus a constant \(C\).

3. **Integral of sin^2(x) dx using a trigonometric identity:**
   \[
   \int \sin^2(x) \, dx = \int \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2} \, dx = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sin(2x)}{4} + C
   \]
   Here, we use the identity \(\sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2}\) to simplify the integral.

These examples illustrate the basic approach to solving trigonometric integrals. More complex cases might involve products of different trigonometric functions or higher powers, requiring more advanced techniques such as integration by parts or substitution.

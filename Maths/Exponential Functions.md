### Understanding Exponential Functions

Exponential functions are a type of mathematical function where the variable appears in the exponent. These functions have the general form \( f(x) = a \cdot b^x \), where \( a \) is a constant, \( b \) is the base (a positive number not equal to 1), and \( x \) is the variable.

The most common example of an exponential function is the growth of populations or compound interest. For instance, if a population doubles every year, starting with an initial size, this can be modeled using an exponential function.

#### Basic Example:
Suppose you have a single bacterium that divides into two identical bacteria every hour. If we let \( P(t) \) represent the number of bacteria after \( t \) hours, and we start with one bacterium (\( P(0) = 1 \)), the number of bacteria at any time can be modeled by the exponential function:

\[ P(t) = 1 \cdot 2^t \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \) (since the population doubles each hour), and \( t \) represents the number of hours that have passed. 

- After 0 hours: \( P(0) = 2^0 = 1 \)
- After 1 hour: \( P(1) = 2^1 = 2 \)
- After 2 hours: \( P(2) = 2^2 = 4 \)
- After 3 hours: \( P(3) = 2^3 = 8 \)

This example illustrates exponential growth, where the quantity increases by a constant factor over equal intervals of time. Exponential functions can also model decay scenarios, such as radioactive decay, where the base \( b \) is between 0 and 1.

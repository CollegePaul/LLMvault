### Understanding Trigonometric Functions in Mathematics

Trigonometric functions are essential tools in mathematics used to relate angles to the lengths of sides of triangles. They are fundamental in fields such as physics, engineering, and architecture. The primary trigonometric functions are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). These functions are defined based on a right-angled triangle:

1. **Sine Function**: For an angle \( \theta \) in a right-angled triangle, the sine of \( \theta \) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite to \( \theta \) (opposite side) to the length of the hypotenuse.
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   
2. **Cosine Function**: The cosine of an angle \( \theta \) is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to \( \theta \) (adjacent side) to the length of the hypotenuse.
   \[
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]

3. **Tangent Function**: The tangent of an angle \( \theta \) is the ratio of the sine of \( \theta \) to the cosine of \( \theta \), or equivalently, it is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
   \[
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
   \]

### Basic Example

Consider a right-angled triangle with one angle \( \theta \), where the opposite side to \( \theta \) is 3 units, and the hypotenuse is 5 units. To find the sine of \( \theta \):
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

To find the cosine of \( \theta \), we first need to determine the length of the adjacent side using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 + \text{opposite}^2 = \text{hypotenuse}^2
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 + 3^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 + 9 = 25
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 = 16
\]
\[
\text{adjacent} = 4
\]

Now, we can find the cosine of \( \theta \):
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

The tangent of \( \theta \) is:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Continuity in Mathematics

Continuity in mathematics refers to the property of a function where small changes in the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output. Essentially, a function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting your pen from the paper. Mathematically, a function \( f(x) \) is said to be continuous at a point \( c \) if the following three conditions are met:

1. The function \( f(c) \) is defined.
2. The limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( c \) exists.
3. The limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( c \) equals \( f(c) \).

To illustrate this with a simple example, consider the function \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \). This is a linear function, and it is continuous everywhere. Let's check its continuity at any point, say \( x = 3 \).

- First, we need to see if \( f(3) \) is defined: \( f(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 7 \), so it is defined.
- Next, we evaluate the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 3: \( \lim_{x \to 3} (2x + 1) = 2(3) + 1 = 7 \).
- Finally, we check if this limit equals \( f(3) \): \( 7 = 7 \).

Since all three conditions are satisfied, the function \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \) is continuous at \( x = 3 \). In fact, since it's a polynomial (and polynomials are continuous everywhere), it is continuous for all real numbers.

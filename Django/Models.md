### Models in Django

In Django, models are Python classes that define the structure of your database tables. Each model corresponds to a single table in your database, and each attribute of the class represents a field in the table. Models allow you to interact with the database using high-level Python code rather than writing raw SQL queries.

Models inherit from `django.db.models.Model`, and they use various field types provided by Django to define the fields of the table, such as `CharField`, `IntegerField`, `DateTimeField`, etc. Here's a simple example of a model for a blog application:

```python
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

In this example:
- The `Author` model has fields for storing the first name, last name, and email of an author.
- The `Post` model includes a title, content, and a foreign key linking to the `Author` model, indicating who wrote the post. It also automatically records when each post was created.

The `__str__` method is overridden in both models to provide a human-readable representation of the objects, which can be useful for debugging and displaying information in the Django admin interface or other parts of your application.

### Getting Started in Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It was developed by experienced developers to handle two challenging web-development problems: it lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly and with less code.

To get started with Django, you first need to set up your environment. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to use virtual environments for Python projects. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate.

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   
   On Windows:

   ```bash
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Django**: With your virtual environment activated, install Django using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

5. **Start a New Project**: Use the `django-admin` command to start a new project.

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

6. **Navigate into Your Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**: Check if your project is set up correctly by running the server.

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Create an App**: Inside your Django project, you can create apps which handle different functionalities of your website.

   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```

9. **Register Your App**: Add your new app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your project’s `settings.py`.

10. **Create Views and Templates**: Define views in your app's `views.py`, and create HTML templates in a `templates` folder within your app.

11. **Define URL Patterns**: Set up URL routing for your application by defining patterns in your app's `urls.py` file, and include this in the project’s main `urls.py`.

Here is a simple example of a view and its corresponding template:

**myapp/views.py**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'name': 'Django'})
```

**templates/home.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to {{ name }}!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

This example demonstrates the basics of rendering a simple template with context data.

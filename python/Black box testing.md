### Black Box Testing in Python

Black box testing is a software testing method where the internal structure and workings of an application are not known to the tester. Instead, testers work with the software's requirements and specifications to design test cases that check if the system behaves as expected under various conditions. The focus is on input and output, ensuring that the software meets its functional requirements without delving into its implementation details.

In Python, black box testing can be performed using various testing frameworks such as `unittest`, `pytest`, or `doctest`. These frameworks allow you to write test cases that feed specific inputs into a function or module and verify if the output matches the expected results.

#### Example using unittest

Here's a simple example of how black box testing might look in Python using the `unittest` framework. Suppose we have a function that calculates the factorial of a number, and we want to test it without knowing its internal implementation:

```python
# factorial.py
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# test_factorial.py
import unittest
from factorial import factorial

class TestFactorial(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_factorial_positive(self):
        self.assertEqual(factorial(5), 120)
    
    def test_factorial_zero(self):
        self.assertEqual(factorial(0), 1)

    def test_factorial_negative(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            factorial(-1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example:
- We have a `factorial` function in `factorial.py`.
- We create a separate file `test_factorial.py` for our tests.
- The `TestFactorial` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
- We define test methods like `test_factorial_positive`, `test_factorial_zero`, and `test_factorial_negative` to verify different scenarios.

When you run the `test_factorial.py` file, `unittest` will execute these test cases and report whether each one passed or failed.

### Introduction to Algorithms in Python

Algorithms in Python refer to sets of instructions or procedures designed to solve specific problems efficiently. These algorithms can range from simple tasks like sorting numbers to complex operations involving data structures and machine learning. Python, with its extensive libraries and easy-to-read syntax, is a popular choice for implementing algorithms.

Python provides several built-in functions and libraries that make it easier to work with algorithms. For example, the `sort()` method can be used to sort lists, while the `collections` module offers specialized container datatypes such as dictionaries and queues which can be useful in algorithm design.

#### Example: Implementing a Simple Sorting Algorithm

One of the most basic algorithms is Bubble Sort. Although not efficient for large datasets (O(n^2) time complexity), it serves well to illustrate the concept of an algorithm:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Traverse through all elements in the list
    for i in range(n-1):
        # Last i elements are already sorted, no need to check them
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage:
my_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_list = bubble_sort(my_list)
print("Sorted array is:", sorted_list)
```

In this example, the `bubble_sort` function takes a list of numbers as input and sorts it in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

#### Example: Using Python Libraries for Efficient Algorithms

For more efficient sorting, Python's built-in `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method can be used. Here is an example:

```python
my_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
# Using sorted() to sort the list
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
print("Sorted array using sorted():", sorted_list)

# Alternatively, sorting the list in place
my_list.sort()
print("Sorted array using list.sort():", my_list)
```

These built-in functions use Timsort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is much more efficient for larger datasets.

### Understanding Mutability in Python

In Python, mutability refers to whether or not an object can be changed after it is created. Objects that can be modified are called mutable, while objects that cannot be altered once they are created are immutable.

#### Mutable Types:
- **Lists**: You can change, add, or remove items after the list creation.
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]
  my_list[0] = 4          # Changing an element
  my_list.append(5)       # Adding an element
  del my_list[1]          # Removing an element
  print(my_list)          # Output: [4, 3, 5]
  ```
- **Dictionaries**: You can add, modify, or delete key-value pairs.
  ```python
  my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
  my_dict['c'] = 3        # Adding a new key-value pair
  my_dict['a'] = 4        # Modifying an existing value
  del my_dict['b']        # Deleting a key-value pair
  print(my_dict)          # Output: {'a': 4, 'c': 3}
  ```
- **Sets**: You can add or remove elements.
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3}
  my_set.add(4)           # Adding an element
  my_set.remove(2)        # Removing an element
  print(my_set)           # Output: {1, 3, 4}
  ```

#### Immutable Types:
- **Tuples**: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its contents.
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
  # my_tuple[0] = 4       # This will raise an error
  print(my_tuple)         # Output: (1, 2, 3)
  ```
- **Strings**: Strings are immutable in Python; any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string.
  ```python
  my_string = "hello"
  new_string = my_string + " world"  # This creates a new string
  print(new_string)                 # Output: hello world
  ```
- **Integers, Floats**: These are also immutable types.

Understanding mutability is crucial for efficient memory management and avoiding unexpected behavior in your programs. For example, passing mutable objects to functions can result in changes that persist outside the function scope, while passing immutable objects ensures that the original data remains unchanged.

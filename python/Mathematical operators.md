### Mathematical Operators in Python

Python supports a variety of mathematical operators that allow users to perform arithmetic operations on numbers. Here's an overview:

1. **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.
   ```python
   result = 5 + 3
   print(result)  # Output: 8
   ```

2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
   ```python
   result = 5 - 3
   print(result)  # Output: 2
   ```

3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two operands.
   ```python
   result = 5 * 3
   print(result)  # Output: 15
   ```

4. **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second and returns a floating-point number.
   ```python
   result = 5 / 2
   print(result)  # Output: 2.5
   ```

5. **Floor Division (//)**: Divides the first operand by the second and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
   ```python
   result = 5 // 2
   print(result)  # Output: 2
   ```

6. **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second.
   ```python
   result = 5 % 3
   print(result)  # Output: 2
   ```

7. **Exponentiation (**): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
   ```python
   result = 5 ** 3
   print(result)  # Output: 125
   ```

8. **Negation (-)**: Negates the number (changes its sign).
   ```python
   result = -5
   print(result)  # Output: -5
   ```

9. **Absolute Value (abs())**: Returns the absolute value of a number.
   ```python
   result = abs(-5)
   print(result)  # Output: 5
   ```

These operators can be used with integers and floating-point numbers in Python to perform a wide range of mathematical calculations. #Mathematical_operators #Python

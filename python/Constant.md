### Explanation of Constants in Python

In Python, there isn't a built-in mechanism to declare constants as you might in other languages like C or Java. Instead, Python uses naming conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. By convention, variables intended to act as constants are typically written in all uppercase letters. While this doesn't enforce immutability or prevent reassignment, it serves as a signal to developers that the value should not be changed.

Here's an example:

```python
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.81

def calculate_area(radius):
    return PI * radius * radius

def calculate_force(mass):
    return mass * GRAVITY

# Using the constants in calculations
area = calculate_area(5)
force = calculate_force(10)

print(f"Area: {area}")
print(f"Force: {force}")
```

In this example, `PI` and `GRAVITY` are treated as constants. While you could technically change their values later in the code, it is not recommended because doing so would violate the expected behavior of these variables throughout your program.

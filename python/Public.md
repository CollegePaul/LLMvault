### Public in Python

In Python, the concept of "public" does not exist in the same way it does in languages like Java or C++. Python uses a convention to indicate that an attribute or method is intended for public use. By default, all attributes and methods are considered public unless they are prefixed with underscores. 

- **Public Attributes/Methods**: These can be accessed directly from outside the class definition. There is no explicit keyword in Python to declare something as public.

Here's a simple example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_variable = "I am public"

    def public_method(self):
        print("This is a public method")

# Creating an instance of the class
obj = MyClass()

# Accessing public attributes and methods
print(obj.public_variable)  # Output: I am public
obj.public_method()         # Output: This is a public method
```

In this example, `public_variable` and `public_method` are considered public because they do not have any leading underscores. They can be accessed directly from outside the class.

### Delimiter in Python

In Python, a delimiter is a character or sequence of characters used to specify the boundary between separate elements in a string. Common delimiters include spaces, commas, semicolons, and newlines. Delimiters are often used when splitting strings into lists or joining lists into strings.

#### Examples:

1. **Splitting a String with a Comma as a Delimiter:**
   ```python
   text = "apple,banana,cherry"
   fruits = text.split(',')
   print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
   ```

2. **Joining a List into a String with a Space as a Delimiter:**
   ```python
   words = ["Hello", "world", "from", "Python"]
   sentence = " ".join(words)
   print(sentence)  # Output: Hello world from Python
   ```

3. **Using Newline as a Delimiter to Split a Multiline String:**
   ```python
   lines = "Line1\nLine2\nLine3"
   line_list = lines.split('\n')
   print(line_list)  # Output: ['Line1', 'Line2', 'Line3']
   ```

4. **Custom Delimiter in Joining:**
   ```python
   items = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
   custom_string = "-".join(items)
   print(custom_string)  # Output: item1-item2-item3
   ```

Delimiters play a crucial role in parsing and formatting data, especially when dealing with file I/O operations or user input. They help in breaking down complex strings into manageable parts or assembling parts into a cohesive string.

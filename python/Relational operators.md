### Relational Operators in Python

Relational operators in Python are used to compare two values and determine their relationship. These operators return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on the comparison. The relational operators available in Python include:

- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if the values of both sides are equal.
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if the values of both sides are not equal.
- **Greater than (`>`):** Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
- **Less than (`<`):** Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

#### Examples:

```python
# Equal to operator
a = 5
b = 5
result = a == b
print("a == b:", result)  # Output: True

# Not equal to operator
c = 10
d = 7
result = c != d
print("c != d:", result)  # Output: True

# Greater than operator
e = 8
f = 4
result = e > f
print("e > f:", result)   # Output: True

# Less than operator
g = 3
h = 6
result = g < h
print("g < h:", result)   # Output: True

# Greater than or equal to operator
i = 9
j = 9
result = i >= j
print("i >= j:", result)  # Output: True

# Less than or equal to operator
k = 2
l = 5
result = k <= l
print("k <= l:", result)  # Output: True
```

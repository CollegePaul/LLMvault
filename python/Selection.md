### Selection in Python

In Python, selection refers to the process of making decisions based on certain conditions. This is typically achieved using `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` statements. These control structures allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a particular condition evaluates to `True` or `False`.

#### Basic Syntax:

- **if statement**: Executes a block of code only if the specified condition is `True`.
  
  ```python
  x = 10
  if x > 5:
      print("x is greater than 5")
  ```

- **elif (else if) statement**: Provides additional conditions to check if the previous conditions were `False`.

  ```python
  x = 4
  if x > 5:
      print("x is greater than 5")
  elif x == 5:
      print("x is equal to 5")
  ```

- **else statement**: Executes a block of code when none of the previous conditions are `True`.

  ```python
  x = 3
  if x > 5:
      print("x is greater than 5")
  elif x == 5:
      print("x is equal to 5")
  else:
      print("x is less than 5")
  ```

#### Combined Example:

Here's a more comprehensive example that combines all three selection statements:

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
elif score >= 60:
    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'F'

print(f"The grade is: {grade}")
```

In this example, the program checks the value of `score` and assigns a corresponding letter grade based on specific ranges. The first condition that evaluates to `True` will execute its block, and any subsequent conditions will be skipped.

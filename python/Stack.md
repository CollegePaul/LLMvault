### Stack in Python

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates where you can only add or remove the top plate.

In Python, stacks can be implemented using lists. You can use the `append()` method to push an item onto the stack and the `pop()` method to remove an item from the top of the stack. Hereâ€™s how you can implement basic stack operations:

```python
# Creating a stack
stack = []

# Pushing elements onto the stack
stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')

print("Stack after pushing:", stack)  # Output: Stack after pushing: ['a', 'b', 'c']

# Popping elements from the stack
top_element = stack.pop()
print("Popped element:", top_element)  # Output: Popped element: c
print("Stack after popping:", stack)    # Output: Stack after popping: ['a', 'b']
```

In this example, we first create an empty list named `stack`. We then push three elements onto the stack using the `append()` method. When we pop an element from the stack, it removes and returns the last element that was added.

Stacks are useful in various applications such as parsing expressions, backtracking algorithms, undo mechanisms, and more. #Stack #Python

### Modularization in Python

Modularization in Python involves organizing code into separate modules, which are essentially files containing Python definitions and statements. This approach enhances the readability, maintainability, and reusability of the code. By breaking down a large program into smaller, manageable pieces, developers can work on different parts independently and easily integrate them.

Modules can contain functions, classes, and variables, and they can be imported into other modules or scripts as needed. Pythonâ€™s standard library is a great example of modularization, with numerous built-in modules providing various functionalities.

#### Example of Modularization

Suppose we are building an application that performs mathematical operations. We can create separate modules for each type of operation.

**math_operations.py**
```python
# This module provides basic arithmetic operations

def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    """Return the difference between a and b."""
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    """Return the product of a and b."""
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    """Return the division of a by b. Raises an error if b is zero."""
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return a / b
```

**main.py**
```python
# This script uses the math_operations module to perform calculations

import math_operations

def main():
    x = 10
    y = 5
    
    print(f"Addition: {math_operations.add(x, y)}")
    print(f"Subtraction: {math_operations.subtract(x, y)}")
    print(f"Multiplication: {math_operations.multiply(x, y)}")
    print(f"Division: {math_operations.divide(x, y)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example:
- `math_operations.py` is a module that contains functions for basic arithmetic operations.
- `main.py` imports the `math_operations` module and uses its functions to perform calculations.

This structure makes it easy to manage and extend the code, as new mathematical operations can be added to `math_operations.py` without modifying `main.py`.

### Overriding in Python

In object-oriented programming, overriding refers to the ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method. When you override a method, the version of the method in the subclass will be called when it is invoked on an instance of the subclass.

Here's a simple example to illustrate overriding:

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some generic sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"

# Creating instances of Dog and Cat
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

# Calling the overridden method
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Bark
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Meow
```

In this example, both `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses of `Animal`. Each subclass overrides the `speak` method to provide a specific sound that is appropriate for the animal. When we create instances of `Dog` and `Cat` and call their `speak` methods, Python uses the overridden methods defined in the subclasses.

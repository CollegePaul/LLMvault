### Tuple in Python

A tuple in Python is an immutable sequence type, which means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses `()`, although the parentheses can be omitted in some cases. They are similar to lists but have one key difference: immutability.

Tuples can store a mix of data types and are useful for grouping related data together. Since they are immutable, tuples provide a way to ensure that the data remains constant throughout the program, which can be beneficial for creating safe data structures.

#### Example Code

```python
# Creating a tuple with different data types
my_tuple = (1, 'hello', 3.14)

# Accessing elements in a tuple using indexing
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: hello

# Tuples can also be unpacked into variables
a, b, c = my_tuple
print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: hello
print(c)  # Output: 3.14

# Trying to modify a tuple element will result in an error
# my_tuple[0] = 2  # Uncommenting this line will raise a TypeError

# Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries due to their immutability
my_dict = {(1, 'a'): 'value'}
print(my_dict[(1, 'a')])  # Output: value

# Tuple methods include count() and index()
print(my_tuple.count('hello'))  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple.index(3.14))     # Output: 2

# Concatenating tuples
tuple1 = (1, 2)
tuple2 = (3, 4)
combined_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
print(combined_tuple)           # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Creating an empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)              # Output: ()

# Creating a single-element tuple (note the trailing comma)
single_element_tuple = (5,)
print(single_element_tuple)     # Output: (5,)
```

### Explanation of Immutable in Python

In Python, immutability refers to objects whose state or content cannot be altered after they are created. This means that once an immutable object is assigned a value, any operations that seem to modify it actually result in the creation of a new object rather than changing the original one.

Immutable types in Python include:
- **int**
- **float**
- **complex**
- **str** (string)
- **tuple**

### Examples of Immutable Objects

1. **Integer Immutability:**
   ```python
   a = 5
   b = a
   b += 3
   print(a)  # Output will be 5
   print(b)  # Output will be 8
   ```
   In this example, `a` and `b` initially point to the same integer object. When we do `b += 3`, it doesn't change the original integer object; instead, a new integer object is created with the value 8, and `b` starts pointing to it.

2. **String Immutability:**
   ```python
   s = "hello"
   t = s.upper()
   print(s)  # Output will be "hello"
   print(t)  # Output will be "HELLO"
   ```
   Here, the original string `s` remains unchanged. The method `upper()` returns a new string `t`, which is in uppercase.

3. **Tuple Immutability:**
   ```python
   t = (1, 2, 3)
   try:
       t[0] = 4
   except TypeError as e:
       print(e)  # Output will be "tuple' object does not support item assignment"
   ```
   This example shows that trying to modify a tuple directly results in a `TypeError` because tuples are immutable.

### Benefits of Immutability

- **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects can be safely shared between threads without synchronization issues.
- **Hashable:** Only immutable types can be used as dictionary keys or elements in sets, as they provide a hash value that remains constant throughout their lifetime.

### Explanation of Declare in Python

In Python, there isn't a keyword specifically named `declare` like in some other programming languages such as C or C++. In Python, variable declaration is implicit. This means you do not need to specify the data type of a variable when you create one. Instead, you simply assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `=`.

For example:

```python
# Implicitly declaring and initializing variables
age = 25          # An integer
name = "Alice"    # A string
height = 5.9      # A float

print(age)        # Output: 25
print(name)       # Output: Alice
print(height)     # Output: 5.9
```

In the code above, `age`, `name`, and `height` are declared implicitly when they are assigned values. Python automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.

### Understanding Private in Python

In Python, there isn't a strict concept of private like in some other languages such as Java or C++. However, Python uses name mangling to achieve similar behavior. When you prefix an attribute or method with double underscores (`__`), Python internally changes the name of that attribute or method to include the class name. This makes it harder (but not impossible) to access from outside the class.

For example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_var = "I am public"
        self.__private_var = "I am private"

    def get_private_var(self):
        return self.__private_var

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.public_var)  # Output: I am public
# print(obj.__private_var)  # This will raise an AttributeError
print(obj.get_private_var())  # Output: I am private
```

In the above example, `__private_var` is intended to be a private attribute. It cannot be accessed directly using its original name from outside the class, but it can still be accessed through methods defined within the class (like `get_private_var`). The actual internal name of `__private_var` would be `_MyClass__private_var`.

This mechanism allows for encapsulation and protects the internal state of an object while providing a controlled way to access or modify that state.

### Arrays in Python

In Python, arrays are not a built-in data type like they are in some other languages such as C or Java. Instead, Python uses lists to handle ordered collections of items. However, Python also provides an `array` module that can be used if you need a more array-like structure with elements of the same type.

Lists in Python are dynamic and can hold elements of different types. Here's how you can create and manipulate lists:

```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Accessing elements by index
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Adding an element to the end of the list
fruits.append('orange')
print(fruits)     # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Removing an element from the list
fruits.remove('banana')
print(fruits)     # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Iterating over a list
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# cherry
# orange
```

If you specifically need an array with elements of the same type, you can use the `array` module. Here's how:

```python
import array

# Creating an array of integers
numbers = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Accessing elements by index
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1

# Adding an element to the end of the array
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)     # Output: array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Iterating over an array
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
```

The `array` module is useful when you need to handle large arrays of basic data types and want a more memory-efficient solution compared to lists. However, for most general purposes in Python, lists are versatile and widely used.

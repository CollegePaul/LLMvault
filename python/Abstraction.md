### Abstraction in Python

Abstraction in Python is a fundamental concept that involves hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows you to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand all the details of how things work internally. In Python, abstraction is often achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces provided by the `abc` module.

Abstract classes are created using the `ABC` class from the `abc` module, and methods within these classes can be declared as abstract using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. Abstract methods do not have an implementation in the abstract class; they must be implemented in any concrete subclass. This enforces a contract that ensures all subclasses provide specific method implementations.

Here's a simple example to illustrate abstraction:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow"

# This will raise an error if you try to instantiate the abstract class directly
# animal = Animal()

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Bark
print(cat.make_sound())  # Output: Meow
```

In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract method `make_sound()`. The classes `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal` and provide their own implementations of the `make_sound()` method. You cannot create an instance of the `Animal` class directly because it contains an abstract method.

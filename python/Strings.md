### Strings in Python

In Python, strings are sequences of characters used to store text. A string can be enclosed within single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """). Strings in Python are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed; any operation on a string will create a new string.

Strings support various operations such as concatenation (joining two strings together), slicing (extracting parts of the string), and repetition (repeating the string multiple times). They also have numerous built-in methods for tasks like finding substrings, changing case, splitting into lists, and more.

**Examples of String Operations in Python:**

1. **Concatenation:**
   ```python
   first_name = "John"
   last_name = "Doe"
   full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # John Doe
   ```

2. **Repetition:**
   ```python
   repeat_string = "Hello" * 3  # HelloHelloHello
   ```

3. **Slicing:**
   ```python
   text = "Python Programming"
   part_of_text = text[7:15]  # Prog
   ```

4. **Built-in Methods:**
   - `.upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.
     ```python
     upper_text = "hello".upper()  # HELLO
     ```
   - `.lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.
     ```python
     lower_text = "WORLD".lower()  # world
     ```
   - `.find()`: Returns the lowest index of a substring if it is found in the string, otherwise returns -1.
     ```python
     position = "Python Programming".find("Programming")  # 7
     ```

5. **Splitting and Joining:**
   - `.split(delimiter)`: Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter.
     ```python
     words = "apple,banana,cherry".split(",")  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
     ```
   - `"delimiter".join(list_of_strings)`: Joins elements of a list into a single string separated by the delimiter.
     ```python
     joined_string = "-".join(["red", "blue", "green"])  # red-blue-green
     ```

### Title: Understanding Nested Loops in Python

A nested loop in Python, as well as other programming languages, refers to one loop inside another. The inner loop runs through all of its iterations each time the outer loop iterates once. This structure is particularly useful when you need to perform operations that require multiple levels of iteration, such as iterating over matrices or generating combinations.

For example, consider a scenario where you want to print out a grid of numbers in a specific format:

```python
# Outer loop runs 3 times
for i in range(1, 4):
    # Inner loop runs 5 times for each outer loop iteration
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(f"({i}, {j})", end=" ")
    print()  # This prints a newline after the inner loop completes
```

In this example:
- The outer loop (`for i in range(1, 4)`) iterates three times with `i` taking values 1, 2, and 3.
- For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop (`for j in range(1, 6)`) runs five times, with `j` taking values from 1 to 5.
- The `print(f"({i}, {j})", end=" ")` statement inside the inner loop prints pairs of `(i, j)` on the same line separated by spaces.
- After each complete iteration of the inner loop, `print()` is called without arguments to move the output to a new line.

This code will produce the following output:
```
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5)
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5)
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5)
```

Nested loops can also be used for more complex operations such as iterating over nested data structures like lists of lists or dictionaries within dictionaries.

### Boolean Data Types in Python

In Python, Boolean data types represent one of two values: `True` or `False`. These values are used to determine the truth value of an expression and are fundamental for controlling program flow through conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

Boolean values can be created directly by assigning `True` or `False` to a variable. Additionally, they often result from comparison operations (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) or logical operations (`and`, `or`, `not`).

Here are some examples:

1. **Direct assignment:**
   ```python
   is_valid = True
   is_empty = False
   ```

2. **Comparison operators:**
   ```python
   x = 5
   y = 10
   print(x < y)  # Output: True
   print(x > y)  # Output: False
   ```

3. **Logical operations:**
   ```python
   a = True
   b = False

   print(a and b)  # Output: False
   print(a or b)   # Output: True
   print(not a)    # Output: False
   ```

Boolean values are essential for making decisions in code, allowing programs to execute different blocks of code based on conditions being met. #Boolean data types #Python

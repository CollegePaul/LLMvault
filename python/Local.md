### Local Variables in Python

In Python, local variables are those that are defined within a function or method and are only accessible from within that block of code. They are created when the function is called and destroyed once the function execution is completed. Local variables cannot be accessed outside their defining function.

For example:

```python
def my_function():
    local_var = "I am local"
    print(local_var)

my_function()
# The following line will raise a NameError because local_var is not accessible here
print(local_var)
```

In the above code, `local_var` is a local variable defined within `my_function`. It can be printed inside the function but attempting to print it outside results in a `NameError`.

Local variables are useful for temporary data that does not need to persist beyond the execution of a function. They help in avoiding conflicts between variables with the same name in different functions and also improve memory management.

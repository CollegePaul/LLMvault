### Decomposition in Python

Decomposition is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems or components. In programming, this means dividing a large task into several smaller functions or modules, each performing a specific part of the overall computation. This approach not only simplifies the problem-solving process but also enhances code readability and reusability.

In Python, decomposition is typically achieved by defining functions. Functions encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task, making it easier to manage complexity. By breaking down a program into multiple functions, you can solve each sub-problem independently and then combine the results to address the main problem.

Here’s an example to illustrate how decomposition works in Python:

Suppose we want to write a program that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, including tax. We can decompose this task into several smaller functions:

1. A function to calculate the subtotal by summing up the prices of all items.
2. A function to calculate the tax based on the subtotal and a given tax rate.
3. A function to compute the total cost by adding the tax to the subtotal.

Here’s how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def calculate_subtotal(prices):
    """Calculate the subtotal of all items."""
    return sum(prices)

def calculate_tax(subtotal, tax_rate):
    """Calculate the tax based on the subtotal and tax rate."""
    return subtotal * tax_rate

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rate):
    """Calculate the total cost including tax."""
    subtotal = calculate_subtotal(prices)
    tax = calculate_tax(subtotal, tax_rate)
    return subtotal + tax

# Example usage
item_prices = [19.99, 5.49, 3.50]
tax_rate = 0.07  # 7% tax rate

total_cost = calculate_total_cost(item_prices, tax_rate)
print(f"The total cost of the items is: ${total_cost:.2f}")
```

In this example:
- `calculate_subtotal` computes the sum of item prices.
- `calculate_tax` applies the tax rate to the subtotal.
- `calculate_total_cost` brings everything together by using the previous two functions.

By decomposing the problem into these smaller, focused functions, we make the code more organized and easier to maintain. Each function has a clear responsibility, which aligns with the principle of separation of concerns. #Decomposition #Python

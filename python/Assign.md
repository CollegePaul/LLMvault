### Assign in Python

In Python, "assign" refers to the process of assigning a value to a variable. This is done using the assignment operator (`=`). When you assign a value to a variable, you are essentially creating a reference to that value in memory. The assignment operator places the data on the right-hand side into the variable on the left-hand side.

For example:
```python
# Assigning an integer to a variable
x = 10

# Assigning a string to a variable
name = "Alice"

# Assigning the result of an expression to a variable
sum_of_numbers = 5 + 3

# Printing the values of the variables
print(x)           # Output: 10
print(name)        # Output: Alice
print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, `x`, `name`, and `sum_of_numbers` are all variables that have been assigned different types of values. The assignment operation allows you to store data in memory so it can be used later in your program.

### Vector Fields in Mathematics

A vector field assigns a vector to each point in a subset of space. This vector can represent various physical quantities such as velocity, force, or magnetic fields at different points in the space. Mathematically, a vector field is often represented by a function that maps each point \((x, y)\) (or \((x, y, z)\)) to a vector \(\mathbf{F}(x, y)\) (or \(\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)\)). 

For example, consider the 2D vector field defined by:
\[
\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (-y, x)
\]
This vector field represents a rotation around the origin. At any point \((x, y)\), the vector points in a direction that is perpendicular to the radius vector from the origin and has a magnitude equal to the distance from the origin.

### Simple Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code using `matplotlib` to visualize the above 2D vector field:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the grid of points
x, y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-5, 5, 10), np.linspace(-5, 5, 10))

# Compute the vectors at each point in the grid
u = -y
v = x

# Plot the vector field
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.quiver(x, y, u, v, color='blue')
plt.title('Vector Field: F(x, y) = (-y, x)')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.grid()
plt.axhline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
plt.axvline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
plt.xlim(-6, 6)
plt.ylim(-6, 6)
plt.show()
```

This code creates a grid of points and calculates the vector \((-y, x)\) at each point, then plots these vectors using `quiver` from `matplotlib`.

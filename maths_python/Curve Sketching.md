### Curve Sketching in Mathematics

Curve sketching involves analyzing functions to understand their behavior and then plotting them on a coordinate system. This process includes identifying important features such as intercepts, asymptotes, critical points (maximums, minimums), inflection points, and intervals of increase or decrease.

To perform curve sketching, follow these steps:
1. **Find the Domain**: Determine where the function is defined.
2. **Intercepts**:
   - Find the x-intercept(s) by setting y = 0 and solving for x.
   - Find the y-intercept by evaluating the function at x = 0.
3. **Symmetry**: Check if the function is even, odd, or neither.
4. **Asymptotes**:
   - Vertical asymptotes occur where the function approaches infinity (common in rational functions).
   - Horizontal and oblique asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and denominator for rational functions.
5. **Critical Points**: Find these by taking the first derivative, setting it to zero, and solving for x. These points indicate potential local maxima or minima.
6. **Concavity and Inflection Points**: Use the second derivative test to determine concavity (upward or downward) and find inflection points where the concavity changes.
7. **Sketch the Curve**: Combine all this information to draw an accurate graph of the function.

### Example in Code

Let's sketch a simple curve, say \( y = x^3 - 3x + 2 \), using Python. We'll perform the necessary analysis and use libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for plotting.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sympy import symbols, diff, solve

# Define the function
def f(x):
    return x**3 - 3*x + 2

# Calculate derivatives
x = symbols('x')
f_prime = diff(f(x), x)
f_double_prime = diff(f_prime, x)

# Find critical points (where first derivative is zero)
critical_points = solve(f_prime, x)

# Find inflection points (where second derivative is zero)
inflection_points = solve(f_double_prime, x)

# Generate values for plotting
x_vals = np.linspace(-3, 3, 400)
y_vals = f(x_vals)

# Plot the function
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, label='y = x^3 - 3x + 2')

# Mark critical points and inflection points
critical_y = [f(point.evalf()) for point in critical_points]
inflection_y = [f(point.evalf()) for point in inflection_points]

plt.scatter(critical_points, critical_y, color='red', label='Critical Points')
plt.scatter(inflection_points, inflection_y, color='green', label='Inflection Points')

# Add labels and legend
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Curve Sketching of y = x^3 - 3x + 2')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code snippet sets up a function \( y = x^3 - 3x + 2 \), calculates its first and second derivatives, finds critical points and inflection points, and plots the curve with these features marked. #Curve Sketching #Maths #python

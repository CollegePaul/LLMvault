### Regression Analysis in Mathematics

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps to understand how the typical value of the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, which models the relationship between a dependent variable \( y \) and an independent variable \( x \) using a linear equation of the form:

\[ y = mx + b \]

where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( x \) is the independent variable.
- \( m \) is the slope of the line.
- \( b \) is the y-intercept.

The goal in regression analysis is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values, known as the least squares method.

### Example in Python

Here's a simple example using Python's `scikit-learn` library to perform linear regression:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data: Independent variable (x) and dependent variable (y)
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape is needed for scikit-learn's API
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

# Create a LinearRegression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(x, y)

# Predict using the model
y_pred = model.predict(x)

# Print the slope (m) and intercept (b)
print(f"Slope (m): {model.coef_[0]}")
print(f"Intercept (b): {model.intercept_}")

# Plotting the results
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Actual data')
plt.plot(x, y_pred, color='red', linewidth=2, label='Regression line')
plt.xlabel('Independent variable (x)')
plt.ylabel('Dependent variable (y)')
plt.title('Linear Regression Example')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this example:
- We define a set of sample data points.
- We create and train a `LinearRegression` model using the `scikit-learn` library.
- We use the trained model to make predictions.
- Finally, we print the slope and intercept of the best-fit line and plot the actual data points along with the regression line.

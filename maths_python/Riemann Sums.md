### Explanation of Riemann Sums in Mathematics

Riemann Sums are a method used to approximate the area under a curve, or more formally, they provide approximations of definite integrals. The idea behind Riemann Sums is to divide the area under a curve into several rectangles and then sum up their areas. There are different ways to choose where to evaluate the function in each subinterval: left endpoints (Left Riemann Sum), right endpoints (Right Riemann Sum), midpoints of intervals (Midpoint Rule), or even using trapezoids instead of rectangles.

For simplicity, let's consider a basic example using the Right Riemann Sum. Suppose we want to approximate the area under the curve \( f(x) = x^2 \) from 0 to 1. We divide the interval [0, 1] into \( n \) equal subintervals and use the right endpoint of each subinterval to determine the height of the rectangle.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:
1. Divide the interval [a, b] into \( n \) subintervals.
2. Determine the width of each subinterval as \( \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n} \).
3. For each subinterval, choose the right endpoint and calculate the height of the rectangle as \( f(x_i) \), where \( x_i \) is the right endpoint of the i-th subinterval.
4. Sum up the areas of all rectangles to approximate the integral.

### Python Code Example

Below is a simple Python code example that calculates the Right Riemann Sum for the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) over the interval [0, 1] with \( n = 100 \).

```python
def right_riemann_sum(f, a, b, n):
    delta_x = (b - a) / n
    total_area = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x_i = a + i * delta_x
        total_area += f(x_i) * delta_x
    
    return total_area

# Define the function f(x) = x^2
def f(x):
    return x**2

# Calculate the Right Riemann Sum from 0 to 1 with n=100
approximation = right_riemann_sum(f, 0, 1, 100)
print("The approximate area under the curve is:", approximation) #Riemann Sums #Maths #python

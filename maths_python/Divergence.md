### Divergence in Mathematics

Divergence is an operator that measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. In simpler terms, it describes how much a vector field spreads out (diverges) from or converges to a particular point. Mathematically, divergence is represented by the dot product of the del operator (âˆ‡) and a vector field F:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}
\]

This equation calculates the net rate of change of the vector field in all directions at a specific point.

### Example in Code

Let's consider a simple 2D vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (x^2, y^2)\). We will compute the divergence of this vector field using Python. For simplicity, we'll use finite differences to approximate the partial derivatives.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the vector field F(x, y)
def F(x, y):
    return x**2, y**2

# Compute the divergence using finite differences
def divergence(F, x, y, dx=1e-5, dy=1e-5):
    Fx, Fy = F(x, y)
    
    # Approximate partial derivatives
    dFx_dx = (F(x + dx, y)[0] - F(x - dx, y)[0]) / (2 * dx)
    dFy_dy = (F(x, y + dy)[1] - F(x, y - dy)[1]) / (2 * dy)
    
    # Divergence is the sum of partial derivatives
    return dFx_dx + dFy_dy

# Example usage
x, y = 3, 4
div = divergence(F, x, y)

print(f"Divergence at point ({x}, {y}): {div}")
```

### Explanation and Output

In this example, we define a vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y) = (x^2, y^2)\). The `divergence` function computes the divergence of this field at a given point using finite differences to approximate the partial derivatives. For the point (3, 4), the divergence is calculated and printed.

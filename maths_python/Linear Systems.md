### Linear Systems in Mathematics

Linear systems are sets of linear equations involving multiple variables. These equations can be expressed in the form:

\[ a_1x + b_1y = c_1 \]
\[ a_2x + b_2y = c_2 \]

where \( x \) and \( y \) are variables, and \( a_1, b_1, c_1, a_2, b_2, \) and \( c_2 \) are constants. The goal is to find values of the variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

To solve such systems, various methods can be used, including substitution, elimination, or matrix operations like Gaussian elimination. In Python, libraries such as NumPy provide functions to solve these systems efficiently.

### Example in Code

Here's a simple example using NumPy to solve a system of two linear equations:

\[ 2x + y = 5 \]
\[ x - 3y = -1 \]

This can be represented in matrix form as \( Ax = b \), where:
\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & -3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad x = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Here's the Python code to solve this system:

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficient matrix A
A = np.array([[2, 1], [1, -3]])

# Constants vector b
b = np.array([5, -1])

# Solve for x
solution = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
print("Solution:", solution)
```

When you run this code, it will output the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations.

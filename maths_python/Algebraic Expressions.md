### Algebraic Expressions in Mathematics

An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain numbers, variables (letters), and operation symbols (such as +, -, *, /). Variables represent unknown values or quantities that can change. Operations are performed on these variables and numbers according to the rules of arithmetic.

For example, consider the expression 3x + 5. Here, 'x' is a variable, 3 and 5 are constants, and '+' is an operator indicating addition. The value of this expression will change depending on what value we assign to x.

### Python Code Example

In Python, we can evaluate algebraic expressions using variables and basic arithmetic operations. Below is a simple example:

```python
# Define the variable
x = 10

# Define the algebraic expression
expression_value = 3 * x + 5

# Print the result
print("The value of the expression 3x + 5 when x =", x, "is:", expression_value)
```

In this code snippet:
- We assign a value to `x` (in this case, 10).
- We calculate the value of the algebraic expression `3x + 5` and store it in `expression_value`.
- Finally, we print out the result.

This example demonstrates how algebraic expressions can be implemented and evaluated using Python. #AlgebraicExpressions #Maths #python

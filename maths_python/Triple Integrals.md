### Triple Integrals in Mathematics

Triple integrals extend the concept of double integrals to three dimensions. They are used to integrate functions over a three-dimensional region, providing a way to calculate volumes, masses, and other quantities that depend on three variables.

A triple integral can be written as:

\[ \iiint_V f(x, y, z) \, dV \]

where \( V \) is the volume in three-dimensional space, and \( f(x, y, z) \) is the function being integrated. The integration process involves integrating over each of the three variables in sequence.

### Example

Consider finding the volume of a region bounded by the paraboloid \( z = x^2 + y^2 \) and the plane \( z = 4 \). This can be solved using a triple integral:

\[ V = \iiint_V dz \, dy \, dx \]

The limits of integration for \( z \) go from \( z = x^2 + y^2 \) to \( z = 4 \). For \( x \) and \( y \), we need to find the region in the \( xy \)-plane where \( x^2 + y^2 \leq 4 \). This is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Therefore, the limits for \( x \) go from \(-2\) to \(2\), and for \( y \) they go from \(-\sqrt{4 - x^2}\) to \(\sqrt{4 - x^2}\).

### Python Code Example

Here is a simple Python code example using `scipy.integrate.dblquad` and `sympy` to evaluate the triple integral:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import integrate

# Define the function to integrate (in this case, 1 since we are calculating volume)
def integrand(z, y, x):
    return 1

# Innermost integral with respect to z from z = x^2 + y^2 to z = 4
def inner_integral(y, x):
    result, _ = integrate.quad(integrand, x**2 + y**2, 4, args=(y, x))
    return result

# Middle integral with respect to y from -sqrt(4 - x^2) to sqrt(4 - x^2)
def middle_integral(x):
    result, _ = integrate.quad(inner_integral, -np.sqrt(4 - x**2), np.sqrt(4 - x**2), args=(x,))
    return result

# Outermost integral with respect to x from -2 to 2
volume, _ = integrate.quad(middle_integral, -2, 2)

print(f"The volume of the region is: {volume}")
```

This code calculates the volume under the paraboloid \( z = x^2 + y^2 \) and above the plane \( z = 4 \), which should output approximately \( 16\pi/3 \).

### Hypothesis Testing in Mathematics

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves setting up two hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H₀), which typically represents no effect or no difference, and the alternative hypothesis (H₁), which suggests an effect or a difference.

The process of hypothesis testing includes:
1. **Formulating Hypotheses**: Clearly define both the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. **Collecting Data**: Gather sample data that is representative of the population.
3. **Choosing a Test Statistic**: Select a statistical test based on the nature of the data and the hypotheses.
4. **Determining the Significance Level (α)**: Set the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, typically 0.05.
5. **Calculating the P-Value**: Compute the probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true.
6. **Making a Decision**: Compare the p-value to the significance level. If the p-value is less than α, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

### Example in Code

Let's consider an example where we want to test if a new teaching method improves student performance on a standardized test compared to the traditional method. We will use a simple t-test for this purpose.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data: scores of students taught with the traditional and new methods
traditional_scores = [80, 75, 90, 85, 60, 88, 92, 78, 76, 84]
new_method_scores = [85, 90, 88, 92, 81, 87, 93, 86, 89, 91]

# Performing a t-test to compare the means of the two groups
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(traditional_scores, new_method_scores)

# Output the results
print(f"T-Statistic: {t_statistic}")
print(f"P-Value: {p_value}")

# Set significance level (alpha)
alpha = 0.05

# Make decision based on p-value and alpha
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: New method improves student performance.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference in performance.")

```

In this example, we compare the mean scores of students taught using two different methods. The t-test helps us determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new teaching method likely improves student performance.

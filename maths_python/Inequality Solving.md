### Inequality Solving in Mathematics

Inequality solving involves finding all values of a variable that satisfy an inequality relation, which can be one of the following: less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (≤), or greater than or equal to (≥). Unlike equations, where we typically find specific solutions, inequalities yield solution sets containing ranges of values.

For example, consider the inequality \(2x + 3 < 7\).

To solve this:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 
   \[
   2x < 4
   \]

2. Divide by 2:
   \[
   x < 2
   \]

This means that any value of \(x\) less than 2 satisfies the inequality.

### Python Code Example

Here is a simple Python code using the `sympy` library to solve the inequality \(2x + 3 < 7\):

```python
from sympy import symbols, solve, S

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define the inequality
inequality = 2*x + 3 < 7

# Solve the inequality
solution = solve(inequality, x)

print("The solution to the inequality is:", solution)
```

In this code:
- We import `symbols`, `solve`, and `S` from the `sympy` library.
- We define the variable \(x\).
- We set up the inequality \(2x + 3 < 7\).
- We use `solve()` to find the solution set, which in this case will output `(-oo < x) & (x < 2)` indicating that \(x\) can take any value less than 2.

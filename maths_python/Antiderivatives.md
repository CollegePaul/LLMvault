### Antiderivatives in Mathematics

An antiderivative, also known as an indefinite integral, is a function that "reverses" the process of differentiation. Essentially, if you have a function \( f(x) \), its antiderivative \( F(x) \) is such that when you differentiate \( F(x) \), you get back the original function \( f(x) \). The notation for finding an antiderivative is:

\[ \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C \]

where \( C \) is known as the constant of integration. This constant arises because the derivative of a constant is zero, so any constant can be added to an antiderivative without changing its validity.

#### Example in Python

To demonstrate finding an antiderivative using Python, we can use the `sympy` library, which is designed for symbolic mathematics. Here's a simple example:

```python
from sympy import symbols, integrate

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define the function f(x) = 2*x
f = 2 * x

# Compute the antiderivative F(x)
F = integrate(f, x)

print("The antiderivative of 2x is:", F)
```

In this code:
- We import `symbols` and `integrate` from the `sympy` library.
- We define \( x \) as a symbol.
- We define the function \( f(x) = 2x \).
- We compute the antiderivative of \( f(x) \) using `integrate(f, x)`.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
The antiderivative of 2x is: x**2
```

This result means that the antiderivative of \( 2x \) is \( x^2 + C \), where \( C \) is an arbitrary constant. #Antiderivatives #Maths #python

### Title: Introduction to Initial Value Problems in Mathematics

An Initial Value Problem (IVP) in mathematics involves finding a solution to a differential equation that satisfies certain initial conditions. These problems are common in many fields of science and engineering, as they help predict the behavior of systems over time given their starting points.

A general form of an IVP for an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0 \]

Here, \( t_0 \) and \( y_0 \) are the initial conditions specifying the value of \( y \) at time \( t_0 \).

### Example

Consider a simple first-order ODE:

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = -2y, \quad y(0) = 1 \]

This equation represents an exponential decay process. The solution to this IVP is:

\[ y(t) = e^{-2t} \]

To solve this numerically using Python, one can use methods like Euler's method or more sophisticated ones from libraries such as SciPy.

### Simple Python Code Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example using Euler's method to solve the above IVP numerically in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the function f(t, y) from the ODE dy/dt = -2y
def f(t, y):
    return -2 * y

# Initial conditions
t0 = 0
y0 = 1

# Time span and step size
t_max = 5
h = 0.1

# Number of steps
n_steps = int((t_max - t0) / h)

# Arrays to store time and solution values
t_values = np.linspace(t0, t_max, n_steps + 1)
y_values = np.zeros(n_steps + 1)
y_values[0] = y0

# Euler's method implementation
for i in range(1, n_steps + 1):
    y_values[i] = y_values[i - 1] + h * f(t_values[i - 1], y_values[i - 1])

# Plotting the results
plt.plot(t_values, y_values, label='Numerical Solution')
plt.plot(t_values, np.exp(-2 * t_values), 'r--', label='Exact Solution')
plt.xlabel('t')
plt.ylabel('y(t)')
plt.title('Solution of dy/dt = -2y with y(0) = 1')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this code:
- We define the function \( f(t, y) \) representing the ODE.
- We set initial conditions and parameters for numerical integration.
- Euler's method is used to approximate the solution over a specified time span.
- The results are plotted alongside the exact analytical solution for comparison.

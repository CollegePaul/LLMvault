### Understanding Random Variables in Mathematics

A random variable is a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon. In other words, it represents numerical values associated with the outcomes of an experiment or process that has some randomness. Random variables can be categorized into two types:

1. **Discrete Random Variable**: Takes on a countable number of distinct values. These values could represent things like the number of heads in a series of coin flips.
2. **Continuous Random Variable**: Can take on any value within a given interval, representing measurements such as temperature or weight.

### Example: Discrete Random Variable

Consider rolling a six-sided die. The outcome of this experiment can be represented by a discrete random variable \( X \), where \( X \) can take on values 1 through 6, each corresponding to one face of the die.

### Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code example demonstrating how to simulate rolling a six-sided die using a discrete random variable. We'll use the `random` module to generate random outcomes:

```python
import random

def roll_die():
    # Simulating a roll of a fair six-sided die
    return random.randint(1, 6)

# Roll the die multiple times and record the results
results = [roll_die() for _ in range(10)]

print("Results of rolling a six-sided die 10 times:", results)
```

In this code:
- The function `roll_die()` simulates the roll of a fair six-sided die by generating a random integer between 1 and 6.
- We then use a list comprehension to simulate rolling the die 10 times, storing each result in the `results` list.

### Example: Continuous Random Variable

For a continuous random variable, consider measuring the height of randomly selected individuals from a population. The height can take on any value within a certain range (e.g., between 4 feet and 7 feet).

### Python Code Example for Continuous Random Variable

Here's a simple Python code example demonstrating how to simulate generating heights using a continuous random variable. We'll use the `random.uniform` function from the `random` module:

```python
import random

def generate_height():
    # Simulating the height of an individual in feet, between 4 and 7 feet
    return random.uniform(4, 7)

# Generate heights for a group of individuals
heights = [generate_height() for _ in range(10)]

print("Simulated heights of 10 individuals (in feet):", heights)
```

In this code:
- The function `generate_height()` simulates the height of an individual by generating a random float between 4 and 7.
- We then use a list comprehension to simulate the heights of 10 individuals, storing each result in the `heights` list.

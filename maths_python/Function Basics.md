### Function Basics in Mathematics

A function in mathematics is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. In simpler terms, a function takes an input (or several inputs), performs some operations on them, and returns an output.

For example, consider the function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \). Here, \( x \) is the input, and the operation performed is multiplying \( x \) by 2 and then adding 3. If we input \( x = 4 \), the function will return \( f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11 \).

### Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code example that demonstrates this function:

```python
def f(x):
    return 2 * x + 3

# Test the function with an input value
input_value = 4
output_value = f(input_value)
print(f"f({input_value}) = {output_value}")
```

In this code, we define a function `f` that takes one parameter `x`. The function returns the result of the expression \( 2x + 3 \). We then test this function with an input value of 4 and print the result.

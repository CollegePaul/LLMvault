### Title: Understanding Multivariable Optimization in Mathematics

Multivariable optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum value of a function that depends on multiple variables. This is common in various fields such as economics, engineering, and data science where decision-making often requires balancing multiple factors.

Consider a simple example where you are trying to maximize profit for a product. The profit \( P \) might be a function of two variables: the price \( x \) and the advertising budget \( y \). Mathematically, this could be represented as:

\[ P(x, y) = -x^2 - 4y^2 + 10x + 8y \]

Here, we want to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that maximize the profit function \( P(x, y) \).

To solve this problem using Python, we can use numerical optimization techniques. One popular method is the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function which minimizes a given objective function. Since we want to maximize the profit, we will minimize the negative of the profit function.

Here's how you can do it in code:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the profit function
def profit(x):
    x1 = x[0]  # price
    x2 = x[1]  # advertising budget
    return -( -x1**2 - 4*x2**2 + 10*x1 + 8*x2 )

# Initial guess for the variables
initial_guess = [0, 0]

# Perform the optimization
result = minimize(profit, initial_guess)

# Extracting the optimal values
optimal_price = result.x[0]
optimal_budget = result.x[1]
max_profit = -result.fun

print(f"Optimal Price: {optimal_price}")
print(f"Optimal Advertising Budget: {optimal_budget}")
print(f"Maximum Profit: {max_profit}")
```

In this code:
- The `profit` function calculates the negative of the profit to convert it into a minimization problem.
- We use `minimize` from `scipy.optimize` with an initial guess for the variables \( x \) and \( y \).
- The result provides the optimal values for price and advertising budget that maximize the profit.

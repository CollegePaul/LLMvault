### Area Between Curves

The concept of the area between curves in mathematics involves calculating the definite integral between two or more functions over a given interval. The area represents the geometric space enclosed by these curves on a Cartesian plane. To find this area, you typically integrate the difference between the top and bottom (or right and left) functions across the specified interval.

For example, consider two functions \( f(x) = x^2 \) and \( g(x) = 4 - x^2 \). To find the area enclosed by these curves from \( x = -2 \) to \( x = 2 \), you need to determine which function is above the other over this interval. In this case, \( g(x) \geq f(x) \) for all \( x \) in \([-2, 2]\).

The area \( A \) between these curves can be calculated using the integral:

\[ A = \int_{-2}^{2} [g(x) - f(x)] \, dx \]

### Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code example that calculates this area using numerical integration with the `scipy.integrate.quad` function.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import integrate

# Define the functions
def f(x):
    return x**2

def g(x):
    return 4 - x**2

# Define the interval
a, b = -2, 2

# Calculate the area between the curves using numerical integration
area, error = integrate.quad(lambda x: g(x) - f(x), a, b)

print(f"The area between the curves from x={a} to x={b} is approximately {area:.4f}")

This code defines two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), sets up the interval of integration, and then computes the area using `scipy.integrate.quad`, which performs numerical integration. The result is printed out with a precision of four decimal places. #Area Between Curves #Maths #python

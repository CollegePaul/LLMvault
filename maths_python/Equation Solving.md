### Equation Solving in Mathematics

Equation solving is a fundamental aspect of mathematics that involves finding the values of variables that satisfy a given equation. An equation typically consists of expressions on both sides of an equals sign, with the goal being to determine which value or values of the variable make the equation true.

For example, consider the linear equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

To solve for \( x \), you would isolate the variable by performing inverse operations. Here's how it works step-by-step:
1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 
   \[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3 \]
   \[ 2x = 4 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{4}{2} \]
   \[ x = 2 \]

Thus, the solution to the equation is \( x = 2 \).

### Python Code Example

Python provides several libraries that can be used for solving equations. One of the most common libraries for this purpose is `sympy`, which is designed for symbolic mathematics.

Here's a simple example using `sympy` to solve the same linear equation:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define the equation 2*x + 3 = 7
equation = Eq(2*x + 3, 7)

# Solve the equation
solution = solve(equation, x)

# Print the solution
print("The solution is:", solution)
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
The solution is: [2]
```

This indicates that \( x = 2 \) is the solution to the equation.

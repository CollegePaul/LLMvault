## Trigonometric Integrals in Mathematics

Trigonometric integrals involve integrating functions that include trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, etc. These types of integrals are common in calculus and physics, often appearing when dealing with periodic phenomena or oscillatory motion.

To solve trigonometric integrals, various techniques can be employed, including:

1. **Basic Trigonometric Identities**: Simplifying the integral using known identities like \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) and \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\).
2. **Integration by Parts**: This method is useful when dealing with products of trigonometric functions.
3. **Substitution Method**: Useful when the integral can be simplified using a substitution, often involving trigonometric substitutions like \(u = \sin x\) or \(u = \tan \frac{x}{2}\).

### Example in Code

Let's consider an example of integrating \(\int \sin^2(x) \, dx\). We can use the identity \(\sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2}\) to simplify the integral. The indefinite integral becomes:

\[
\int \sin^2(x) \, dx = \int \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2} \, dx
\]

This can be further simplified and integrated term by term.

Here is a Python code example using `sympy` to perform this integration symbolically:

```python
from sympy import symbols, sin, integrate, cos

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define the function to integrate
function = sin(x)**2

# Perform the integration
integral_result = integrate(function, x)

print("The integral of sin^2(x) is:", integral_result)
```

Running this code will output:

```
The integral of sin^2(x) is: x/2 - sin(2*x)/4
```

This result confirms our manual calculation using the identity. The integral \(\int \sin^2(x) \, dx = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sin(2x)}{4} + C\), where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

### Implicit Differentiation in Mathematics

Implicit differentiation is a technique used to find the derivative of an implicit function, which is a function that is defined by an equation involving both dependent and independent variables. Unlike explicit functions where \( y \) is directly expressed as a function of \( x \), such as \( y = f(x) \), implicit functions are written in the form \( F(x, y) = 0 \).

The process involves differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to one variable (typically \( x \)), treating the other variable(s) as implicitly defined functions of that variable. The chain rule is then used wherever necessary to differentiate terms involving the dependent variable.

### Example

Consider the implicit function given by the equation:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = 25 \]

To find \( \frac{dy}{dx} \), we differentiate both sides with respect to \( x \):

\[
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(25)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + 2y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
\]

Solving for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):

\[
2y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x
\]

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}
\]

### Simple Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code example using the SymPy library to perform implicit differentiation:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Define the implicit function x^2 + y^2 = 25
implicit_function = x**2 + y**2 - 25

# Implicitly differentiate the function with respect to x
dy_dx = sp.idiff(implicit_function, y, x)

# Print the result
print("The derivative dy/dx is:", dy_dx)
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
The derivative dy/dx is: -x/y
```

This matches our manual calculation.

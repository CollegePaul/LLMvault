### Volume of Revolution

Volume of Revolution refers to the volume of a solid formed by rotating a two-dimensional area around an axis. This concept is commonly used in calculus, particularly when calculating volumes of solids generated by revolving curves or regions bounded by curves about an axis.

For example, consider a simple curve like \( y = x^2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \). If you rotate this curve around the x-axis, it forms a paraboloid. The volume of this solid can be calculated using the disk method or the shell method.

The formula for the volume of revolution using the disk method is:
\[ V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx \]

Here's a simple Python code example that uses numerical integration (via the `scipy.integrate.quad` function) to calculate the volume of the solid formed by revolving \( y = x^2 \) around the x-axis from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \):

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import integrate

# Define the function to be revolved
def f(x):
    return x**2

# Define the integrand for the volume of revolution (disk method)
def integrand(x):
    return np.pi * (f(x))**2

# Calculate the volume of revolution from x = 0 to x = 1
volume, error = integrate.quad(integrand, 0, 1)

print(f"The volume of the solid formed by revolving y = x^2 around the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 1 is approximately {volume:.6f}.")

This code defines the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), sets up the integrand for the disk method, and then computes the volume using numerical integration. The result is printed out with a precision of six decimal places.

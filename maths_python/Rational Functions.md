### Rational Functions in Mathematics

A rational function is any function that can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomial functions. In other words, if \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials where \( Q(x) \neq 0 \), then the function \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) is a rational function.

Rational functions can have various features such as vertical asymptotes (where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero), horizontal or oblique asymptotes, and x-intercepts (zeros of the numerator). The behavior of these functions can be analyzed by examining their polynomial components.

### Example in Code

Here's a simple Python code example that defines a rational function and evaluates it for some values:

```python
def rational_function(x):
    # Define the polynomials P(x) = x^2 - 1 and Q(x) = x - 1
    numerator = x**2 - 1
    denominator = x - 1
    
    # Check if the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        return "Undefined"
    
    # Calculate the value of the rational function
    result = numerator / denominator
    return result

# Test the rational function for some values
test_values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
results = {x: rational_function(x) for x in test_values}

print(results)
```

In this example:
- The polynomial \( P(x) \) is defined as \( x^2 - 1 \).
- The polynomial \( Q(x) \) is defined as \( x - 1 \).
- The function `rational_function` calculates the value of \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \).

Note that at \( x = 1 \), the denominator becomes zero, and thus the function is undefined. For other values, it evaluates normally.

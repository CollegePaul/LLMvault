### Second-Order Differential Equations in Mathematics

Second-order differential equations are mathematical equations that involve an unknown function of one variable and its second derivative. They can be expressed in the general form:

\[ a(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + b(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + c(x)y = f(x) \]

where \( y \) is the unknown function, \( x \) is the independent variable, and \( a(x), b(x), c(x) \), and \( f(x) \) are functions of \( x \).

A common example of a second-order differential equation is the simple harmonic motion equation:

\[ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \omega^2 y = 0 \]

where \( y(t) \) represents the displacement as a function of time, and \( \omega \) is the angular frequency.

To solve such equations numerically in Python, one can use libraries like `scipy` which provide functions for solving differential equations. Hereâ€™s an example code that solves the simple harmonic motion equation:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the second-order ODE as a system of first-order ODEs
def simple_harmonic_oscillator(t, y):
    omega = 1.0  # angular frequency
    dydt = [y[1], -omega**2 * y[0]]
    return dydt

# Initial conditions: y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0
initial_conditions = [1, 0]

# Time span for the solution
t_span = (0, 10)

# Solve the ODE using solve_ivp
solution = solve_ivp(simple_harmonic_oscillator, t_span, initial_conditions, dense_output=True)

# Generate time points and compute y values
t_points = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 300)
y_points = solution.sol(t_points)[0]

# Plot the result
plt.plot(t_points, y_points, label='y(t)')
plt.title('Simple Harmonic Motion')
plt.xlabel('Time (t)')
plt.ylabel('Displacement (y)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code defines a simple harmonic oscillator as a system of first-order differential equations and uses `solve_ivp` from `scipy.integrate` to solve it over a specified time span. The solution is then plotted using `matplotlib`.

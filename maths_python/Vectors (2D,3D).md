### Understanding Vectors in Mathematics

Vectors are mathematical objects used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They are fundamental in physics and engineering for modeling forces, velocities, and other physical properties.

#### 2D Vectors:
A 2D vector is defined by two components, typically denoted as (x, y). These components indicate the displacement along the x-axis and y-axis respectively. For example, a vector v = (3, 4) means moving 3 units in the x-direction and 4 units in the y-direction.

#### 3D Vectors:
A 3D vector extends this concept to three dimensions, with components (x, y, z). These components represent displacements along the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. For example, a vector v = (1, 2, 3) indicates moving 1 unit in the x-direction, 2 units in the y-direction, and 3 units in the z-direction.

### Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code that demonstrates basic operations with 2D and 3D vectors using the `numpy` library:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a 2D vector
vector_2d = np.array([3, 4])

# Define a 3D vector
vector_3d = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Vector addition
vector_addition_2d = vector_2d + np.array([1, -1])
vector_addition_3d = vector_3d + np.array([-1, 1, 0])

# Vector magnitude (length)
magnitude_2d = np.linalg.norm(vector_2d)
magnitude_3d = np.linalg.norm(vector_3d)

print("2D Vector:", vector_2d)
print("2D Vector Addition:", vector_addition_2d)
print("Magnitude of 2D Vector:", magnitude_2d)
print("\n3D Vector:", vector_3d)
print("3D Vector Addition:", vector_addition_3d)
print("Magnitude of 3D Vector:", magnitude_3d)
```

This code snippet creates 2D and 3D vectors, performs addition on them, and calculates their magnitudes.

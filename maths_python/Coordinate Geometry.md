### Coordinate Geometry in Mathematics

Coordinate geometry, also known as analytic geometry or Cartesian geometry, is a branch of mathematics that uses pairs of numbers, called coordinates, to determine the position of points, lines, curves, and other geometric elements on a plane. The most common coordinate system used in coordinate geometry is the Cartesian coordinate system, which consists of two perpendicular number lines: the x-axis (horizontal) and the y-axis (vertical). The point where these axes intersect is called the origin, with coordinates (0, 0).

In this system, any point can be uniquely identified by an ordered pair of numbers (x, y), where x represents the horizontal distance from the origin and y represents the vertical distance. For example, the point (3, 4) is located 3 units to the right of the origin along the x-axis and 4 units above the origin along the y-axis.

### Example in Code

Let's consider a simple example where we calculate the distance between two points using the distance formula derived from coordinate geometry. The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:

\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    # Unpack the points into individual coordinates
    x1, y1 = point1
    x2, y2 = point2
    
    # Calculate the differences in each dimension
    delta_x = x2 - x1
    delta_y = y2 - y1
    
    # Apply the distance formula
    distance = math.sqrt(delta_x**2 + delta_y**2)
    
    return distance

# Example points
point_a = (3, 4)
point_b = (6, 8)

# Calculate and print the distance between point_a and point_b
distance_ab = calculate_distance(point_a, point_b)
print(f"The distance between {point_a} and {point_b} is {distance_ab:.2f}")

# Output: The distance between (3, 4) and (6, 8) is 5.00
```

This code defines a function `calculate_distance` that takes two tuples representing points and returns the Euclidean distance between them. It then calculates the distance between the points (3, 4) and (6, 8).

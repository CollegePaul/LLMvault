### Sequences in Mathematics

In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of numbers (or other objects) called terms. The terms can be generated by a rule or formula, and they follow a specific pattern. Sequences can be finite or infinite. For example, the sequence of natural numbers starting from 1 is an infinite sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...

Sequences are fundamental in various fields of mathematics, including calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics. They are used to model real-world phenomena such as population growth or the behavior of algorithms.

### Example Code in Python

Here's a simple example of generating an arithmetic sequence in Python. An arithmetic sequence is one where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. For instance, in the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., the common difference is 3.

```python
def generate_arithmetic_sequence(start, difference, n_terms):
    sequence = []
    current_term = start
    for _ in range(n_terms):
        sequence.append(current_term)
        current_term += difference
    return sequence

# Generate the first 5 terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from 2 with a common difference of 3
sequence = generate_arithmetic_sequence(2, 3, 5)
print("Arithmetic Sequence:", sequence)
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Arithmetic Sequence: [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]
```

This code defines a function `generate_arithmetic_sequence` that takes three parameters: the starting term (`start`), the common difference (`difference`), and the number of terms to generate (`n_terms`). It then generates the sequence by iteratively adding the difference to the current term. #Sequences #Maths #python

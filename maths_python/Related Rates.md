### Understanding Related Rates in Mathematics

Related rates problems involve finding the rate at which one quantity changes in relation to another when both quantities are varying over time. These problems often require using derivatives to express the relationship between the rates of change.

#### Example:
Consider a spherical balloon being inflated such that its volume \( V \) increases with respect to time \( t \). The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. If we know how fast the volume is increasing, i.e., \( \frac{dV}{dt} \), we can find out how fast the radius is increasing, i.e., \( \frac{dr}{dt} \).

Using implicit differentiation with respect to time \( t \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt} \]

If the volume of the balloon is increasing at a rate of \( 10 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s} \) when the radius is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \), we can solve for \( \frac{dr}{dt} \):

\[ 10 = 4\pi (5)^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt} \]

Solving for \( \frac{dr}{dt} \):

\[ \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{10}{4\pi(25)} = \frac{1}{10\pi} \, \text{cm/s} \]

### Python Code Example

Here is a simple Python code to calculate the rate of change of the radius (\(\frac{dr}{dt}\)) given the rate of change of volume (\(\frac{dV}{dt}\)) and the radius \( r \).

```python
import math

def dr_dt(dV_dt, r):
    return dV_dt / (4 * math.pi * r**2)

# Given values
dV_dt = 10  # rate of change of volume in cm^3/s
r = 5       # radius in cm

# Calculate the rate of change of radius
rate_of_change_radius = dr_dt(dV_dt, r)
print(f"The rate of change of the radius is {rate_of_change_radius:.4f} cm/s")

```

This code defines a function `dr_dt` that computes the rate of change of the radius given the rate of change of volume and the current radius. It then uses this function with specific values to demonstrate how related rates can be solved programmatically.

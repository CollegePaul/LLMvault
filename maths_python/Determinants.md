### Determinants in Mathematics

Determinants are scalar values that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and reflect certain properties of the matrix. They are crucial in linear algebra for solving systems of linear equations, finding the inverse of a matrix, and determining if a matrix is invertible (non-singular). The determinant of a matrix \( A \) is denoted as \( \det(A) \) or \( |A| \).

For a 2x2 matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}
\]
The determinant is calculated using the formula:
\[
\det(A) = ad - bc
\]

For larger matrices, the calculation becomes more complex, involving the concept of minors and cofactors. However, the 2x2 matrix example is sufficient to illustrate the basic idea.

### Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code example using NumPy to calculate the determinant of a 2x2 matrix:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a 2x2 matrix
matrix = np.array([[4, 7], [2, 6]])

# Calculate the determinant
determinant = np.linalg.det(matrix)

print("The determinant of the matrix is:", determinant)
```

In this example, we define a 2x2 matrix and use NumPy's `linalg.det` function to compute its determinant. The output will be the scalar value representing the determinant.

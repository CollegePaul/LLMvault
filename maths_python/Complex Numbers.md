### Complex Numbers in Mathematics

Complex numbers are an extension of real numbers that incorporate a second dimension, often referred to as the imaginary component. A complex number is typically expressed in the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) is the real part and \(b\) is the imaginary part, with \(i\) being the square root of \(-1\). The imaginary unit \(i\) is crucial because it allows us to solve equations that have no solutions within the realm of real numbers.

For example, consider the equation \(x^2 + 1 = 0\). In the set of real numbers, there is no solution since \(x^2\) would always be non-negative. However, in the complex number system, we can express the solution as \(x = i\) or \(x = -i\).

### Python Code Example

Here's a simple Python code snippet that demonstrates basic operations with complex numbers:

```python
# Define two complex numbers
z1 = 2 + 3j
z2 = 4 - 5j

# Addition of complex numbers
addition_result = z1 + z2
print(f"Addition: {addition_result}")

# Subtraction of complex numbers
subtraction_result = z1 - z2
print(f"Subtraction: {subtraction_result}")

# Multiplication of complex numbers
multiplication_result = z1 * z2
print(f"Multiplication: {multiplication_result}")

# Division of complex numbers
division_result = z1 / z2
print(f"Division: {division_result}")
```

In this example, `z1` and `z2` are two complex numbers. The code performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on these numbers using Python's built-in support for complex numbers.

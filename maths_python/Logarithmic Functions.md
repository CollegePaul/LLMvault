### Logarithmic Functions in Mathematics

Logarithmic functions are the inverse operations to exponentiation. In simpler terms, while exponentiation asks "what is \( b \) raised to the power of \( x \)" (written as \( b^x \)), logarithmic functions ask "to what power must \( b \) be raised to get \( x \)" (written as \( \log_b(x) \)).

For example, if we have \( 2^3 = 8 \), the corresponding logarithmic statement is \( \log_2(8) = 3 \). Here, the base of the logarithm is 2, and it tells us that 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.

Logarithmic functions are widely used in various fields such as computer science (for analyzing algorithms' time complexity), physics (for measuring earthquake intensity on the Richter scale), and finance (for calculating compound interest).

### Simple Python Code Example

Here is a simple Python code example that demonstrates how to calculate logarithms using the `math` module:

```python
import math

# Define base and number
base = 2
number = 8

# Calculate logarithm of 'number' with base 'base'
log_result = math.log(number, base)

print(f"The logarithm of {number} with base {base} is: {log_result}")

# Using natural logarithm (base e)
natural_log_result = math.log(number)
print(f"The natural logarithm of {number} is: {natural_log_result}")
```

In this example:
- We import the `math` module, which contains various mathematical functions.
- We define a base and a number for which we want to find the logarithm.
- We use `math.log()` function to calculate the logarithm of the given number with a specified base. If no base is provided, it calculates the natural logarithm (base e).
- The results are printed out.

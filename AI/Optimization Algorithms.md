### Optimization Algorithms in AI

Optimization algorithms play a crucial role in artificial intelligence by helping to find the best solution from a set of possible solutions, often in scenarios where the goal is to minimize or maximize an objective function. These algorithms are fundamental in training machine learning models, where they adjust model parameters to improve performance on a given task.

In AI, optimization problems can range from simple linear programs to complex non-linear and constrained optimizations. Common types of optimization algorithms used in AI include:

1. **Gradient Descent**: This is one of the most widely used optimization algorithms for training neural networks. It iteratively adjusts the model parameters by moving them in the direction that reduces the loss function.

2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: A variant of gradient descent, SGD updates the model parameters using only a single or a few training examples at each step, making it faster and more suitable for large datasets.

3. **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**: This algorithm combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent that are concerned with adaptive learning rates; AdaGrad and RMSProp. It is widely used in deep learning due to its efficiency and performance.

4. **Genetic Algorithms**: Inspired by the process of natural selection, genetic algorithms use operations such as mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve solutions over successive generations.

5. **Simulated Annealing**: This probabilistic technique explores a large space of possible solutions by moving between them based on a probability function that allows for occasional uphill moves to escape local optima.

### Example Using Python: Gradient Descent

Let's consider a simple example using gradient descent to find the minimum of a quadratic function, \( f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4 \).

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the function and its derivative
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 4*x + 4

def df(x):
    return 2*x + 4

# Gradient Descent implementation
def gradient_descent(starting_point, learning_rate, num_iterations):
    x = starting_point
    history = [x]
    
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        gradient = df(x)
        x -= learning_rate * gradient
        history.append(x)
        
    return x, history

# Parameters
starting_point = 10.0
learning_rate = 0.1
num_iterations = 20

# Run Gradient Descent
final_x, x_history = gradient_descent(starting_point, learning_rate, num_iterations)

print("Final value of x:", final_x)
print("History of x values:", x_history)

# Plot the function and the path taken by gradient descent
x_vals = np.linspace(-10, 2, 400)
y_vals = f(x_vals)

plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, label='f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4')
plt.scatter(x_history, [f(x) for x in x_history], color='red', label='Gradient Descent Path')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('f(x)')
plt.title('Gradient Descent Optimization')
plt.show()
```

In this example, the `gradient_descent` function iteratively updates its position by moving in the direction of the negative gradient until it converges to a minimum. The plot shows how the algorithm progresses towards the minimum value.

### Sigmoid Function in AI

The Sigmoid function is a mathematical function often used in artificial intelligence, particularly in neural networks and logistic regression models. It maps any real-valued number into the range (0, 1), making it useful for problems where binary outcomes are required, such as classification tasks. The function has an "S"-shaped curve that asymptotically approaches 0 on the left and 1 on the right.

The formula for the Sigmoid function is:

\[ \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \]

In neural networks, the Sigmoid activation function helps introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. However, one of its limitations is that it can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes training deep networks challenging.

### Example Using Python

Here's how you can implement and visualize a Sigmoid function using Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the Sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Generate a range of values for x
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)

# Compute the Sigmoid function for each value in x
y = sigmoid(x)

# Plotting the Sigmoid function
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(x, y, label='Sigmoid Function')
plt.title('Plot of the Sigmoid Function')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sigmoid(x)')
plt.axhline(0.5, color='gray', linestyle='--', linewidth=1)
plt.axvline(0, color='gray', linestyle='--', linewidth=1)
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code snippet generates a plot of the Sigmoid function, showing its characteristic "S"-shaped curve. The dashed lines indicate the points where \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0.5 \), highlighting the midpoint of the function's range.

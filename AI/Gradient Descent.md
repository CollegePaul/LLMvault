### Understanding Gradient Descent in AI

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning to minimize a cost function or loss function, which represents how well the model's predictions match the actual data. The primary goal of using gradient descent is to find the values of the parameters that result in the lowest possible value of the cost function.

The algorithm works by iteratively adjusting the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient (the derivative) of the loss function with respect to the parameters. This process involves calculating the gradient at the current set of parameters, multiplying it by a learning rate (a small constant that determines the size of the steps taken towards the minimum), and updating the parameters accordingly.

There are several variants of Gradient Descent:
1. **Batch Gradient Descent:** Uses the entire training dataset to compute the gradient.
2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Updates the parameters for each training example individually, which can lead to faster convergence.
3. **Mini-batch Gradient Descent:** A compromise between batch and stochastic methods, where the dataset is divided into small batches.

### Example using Python

Let's consider a simple linear regression problem where we want to find the best-fitting line \( y = mx + b \) for some given data points.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(0)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Add x0 = 1 to each instance for the intercept term (bias)
X_b = np.c_[np.ones((100, 1)), X] 

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.1
n_iterations = 1000
m = len(X_b) # number of training examples

# Initial parameters (random values)
theta = np.random.randn(2, 1)

for iteration in range(n_iterations):
    gradients = 2/m * X_b.T.dot(X_b.dot(theta) - y)
    theta = theta - learning_rate * gradients

print("Optimal parameters:", theta)

# Plotting the results
X_new = np.array([[0], [2]])
X_new_b = np.c_[np.ones((2, 1)), X_new] 
y_predict = X_new_b.dot(theta)

plt.plot(X_new, y_predict, "r-", label="Predictions")
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.xlabel("x1")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.title("Linear Regression using Gradient Descent")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this example, we generate a dataset with a linear relationship between X and y. We then apply Batch Gradient Descent to find the optimal parameters (slope and intercept) for the line that best fits the data.

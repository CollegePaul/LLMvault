### Explanation of NLTK in AI

NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a powerful library in Python specifically designed for working with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. NLTK's goal is to support research and development in natural language processing (NLP) by providing tools that facilitate the analysis and manipulation of large volumes of text data.

#### Example: Tokenizing Text

Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units, called tokens. Hereâ€™s how you can use NLTK to tokenize sentences and words:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # Download the Punkt tokenizer models

from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize

# Sample text
text = "NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data."

# Tokenizing sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
print("Sentences:", sentences)

# Tokenizing words
words = word_tokenize(text)
print("Words:", words)
```

This example demonstrates how to split text into sentences and words using NLTK's `sent_tokenize` and `word_tokenize` functions. The output will show the sentence-level and word-level breakdown of the provided text.

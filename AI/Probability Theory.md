### Probability Theory in AI

Probability theory plays a crucial role in artificial intelligence, particularly in areas like machine learning, data analysis, and decision-making processes. It provides a framework to handle uncertainty and make predictions based on incomplete information.

In AI, probability theory is used to:

1. **Model Uncertainty**: Real-world scenarios often involve uncertainty. Probability distributions can model this uncertainty, allowing AI systems to reason about possible outcomes.
   
2. **Bayesian Networks**: These are graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships among a set of variables. They are useful in various applications like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting.

3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Many machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models, and Bayesian Networks, rely on probability theory to make predictions or classify data.

4. **Decision Making Under Uncertainty**: In AI, decision-making processes often require handling uncertainty. Techniques like reinforcement learning use probability to learn optimal actions in uncertain environments.

5. **Inference**: Probability theory is used for inference, which involves drawing conclusions from available evidence. This is critical in tasks like natural language processing and computer vision.

### Example: Naive Bayes Classifier in Python

Let's consider a simple example of using the Naive Bayes algorithm for spam detection using Python and the `scikit-learn` library.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample dataset
emails = [
    'Congratulations, you have won a lottery! Claim now.',
    'Hi John, can we reschedule our meeting?',
    'Get cheap meds online, no prescription needed!',
    'Your package has been shipped and will arrive tomorrow.',
    'Win free tickets to the concert this weekend!'
]
labels = ['spam', 'ham', 'spam', 'ham', 'spam']

# Convert text data into numerical data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(emails)

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Train Naive Bayes classifier
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

# Example of predicting a new email
new_email = ['You have been selected for a prize!']
new_email_transformed = vectorizer.transform(new_email)
prediction = classifier.predict(new_email_transformed)
print(f'The email is classified as: {prediction[0]}')
```

In this example, the Naive Bayes algorithm is used to classify emails as either 'spam' or 'ham'. The `CountVectorizer` converts text data into a matrix of token counts, which is then used by the `MultinomialNB` classifier to make predictions.

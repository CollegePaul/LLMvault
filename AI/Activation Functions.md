### Understanding Activation Functions in AI

Activation functions are crucial components in neural networks as they introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns from data. Without activation functions, a neural network would essentially be a linear regression model, regardless of its depth.

#### Types of Activation Functions:

1. **Step Function**: The simplest form where the output is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the input exceeds a certain threshold.
2. **Sigmoid Function**: Produces outputs between 0 and 1. It is often used in binary classification problems. Mathematically, it can be represented as \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \).
3. **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent) Function**: Similar to the sigmoid function but maps inputs to a range of -1 to 1. It is defined as \( tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \).
4. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Function**: Outputs the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it outputs zero. Mathematically, \( ReLU(x) = max(0, x) \). Variants like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU address some of the limitations of standard ReLU.
5. **Softmax Function**: Used in multi-class classification problems to convert raw model outputs into probabilities by applying an exponential function followed by normalization.

#### Example Using Python:

Here's a simple example using NumPy and TensorFlow/Keras to demonstrate how these functions can be implemented and used in neural networks.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample input data
x = np.array([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0])

# Step Function
def step_function(x):
    return (x >= 0).astype(int)

print("Step Function:", step_function(x))

# Sigmoid Function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

print("Sigmoid Function:", sigmoid(x))

# Tanh Function
def tanh(x):
    return np.tanh(x)

print("Tanh Function:", tanh(x))

# ReLU Function
def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

print("ReLU Function:", relu(x))

# Softmax Function
def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))  # Subtracting max(x) for numerical stability
    return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=0)

print("Softmax Function:", softmax(x))
```

In this example, we define and apply various activation functions to a sample input array. These functions can be used as layers in neural networks built with TensorFlow/Keras or other deep learning frameworks.

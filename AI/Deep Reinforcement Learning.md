### Deep Reinforcement Learning in AI

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combines the techniques of deep learning and reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data, and unsupervised learning, which seeks to infer hidden patterns from unlabelled data, reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. Deep reinforcement learning leverages deep neural networks to approximate the value functions or policies that guide the decision-making process of the agent.

In DRL, the agent receives observations from the environment and takes actions, which then result in new observations and rewards. The goal is for the agent to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward over time. This involves complex interactions between exploration (trying out new strategies) and exploitation (using known strategies).

#### Example: CartPole using Deep Q-Networks

The CartPole problem is a classic example used to demonstrate reinforcement learning techniques, including DRL. The objective here is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying forces to the cart.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Create and initialize the environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_size = env.action_space.n

# Build and compile the neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=state_size, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(action_size, activation='linear'))
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001))

# Training the agent
episodes = 500
for e in range(episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_size])
    done = False
    time_t = 0

    while not done:
        # Render the environment for visualization (optional)
        env.render()

        # Epsilon-greedy action selection
        if np.random.rand() <= 0.5:
            action = np.random.choice(action_size)  # Explore action space randomly
        else:
            act_values = model.predict(state)       # Exploit learned values
            action = np.argmax(act_values[0])

        # Take the action and observe the environment's response
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        reward = reward if not done else -10        # Penalize for failure

        next_state = np.reshape(next_state, [1, state_size])
        target = reward

        if not done:
            target += 0.95 * np.amax(model.predict(next_state)[0])  # Discounted future rewards

        # Update the neural network
        target_f = model.predict(state)
        target_f[0][action] = target
        model.fit(state, target_f, epochs=1, verbose=0)

        state = next_state
        time_t += 1

    print(f"Episode: {e}/{episodes}, Score: {time_t}")

# Close the environment
env.close()
```

In this example, a simple neural network is trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn how to balance the pole on the cart. The agent receives positive rewards for keeping the pole upright and negative rewards when it falls down, encouraging the model to develop strategies that maintain stability.

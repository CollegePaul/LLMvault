### Understanding Linear Regression in AI

Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used in artificial intelligence and machine learning to model the relationship between a dependent variable (often called the target or outcome) and one or more independent variables (also known as features or predictors). It assumes that there exists a linear relationship between the input variables and the output, which can be represented by an equation.

In its simplest form, Linear Regression with one feature (univariate linear regression) is expressed as:
\[ y = mx + b \]
where \(y\) is the dependent variable, \(x\) is the independent variable, \(m\) is the slope of the line, and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

When there are multiple features involved, it is known as multivariate linear regression, which can be expressed as:
\[ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n \]
where \(b_0\) is the intercept and \(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n\) are the coefficients for each feature.

Linear Regression aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and those predicted by the model. This process is often performed using optimization algorithms like gradient descent.

#### Example in Python

Let's consider a simple example where we use Linear Regression to predict house prices based on their size (in square feet). We'll use the `scikit-learn` library, which provides easy-to-use tools for implementing machine learning models.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data: House sizes and corresponding prices
sizes = np.array([[750], [800], [850], [900], [950]])
prices = np.array([150000, 160000, 170000, 180000, 190000])

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model with the sample data
model.fit(sizes, prices)

# Predicting the price of a house with size 1000 sqft
predicted_price = model.predict(np.array([[1000]]))
print(f"Predicted price for a 1000 sqft house: ${predicted_price[0]:.2f}")

# Plotting the data points and the regression line
plt.scatter(sizes, prices, color='blue', label='Actual Prices')
plt.plot(sizes, model.predict(sizes), color='red', linewidth=2, label='Regression Line')
plt.xlabel('Size (sqft)')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.title('House Price Prediction using Linear Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this example, we have a small dataset of house sizes and their corresponding prices. We use `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn` to fit the data points and then predict the price for a new house size. Finally, we visualize the relationship between house sizes and prices along with the regression line.

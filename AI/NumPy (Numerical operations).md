### Understanding NumPy in AI

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is an essential library in the field of data science and machine learning. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. This capability is crucial in AI because many algorithms require extensive numerical computations.

In AI, NumPy is used extensively for handling datasets, performing operations like matrix multiplications, vector transformations, and statistical analyses. The library's ability to handle large data sets quickly makes it a preferred choice over standard Python lists for scientific computing tasks.

#### Example: Using NumPy in AI

Let's consider an example where we use NumPy to preprocess data before feeding it into a machine learning model. Suppose we have a dataset of features and labels, and we want to normalize the feature values (a common preprocessing step).

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset: Features (4 samples, 3 features each)
features = np.array([[150, 70, 22],
                     [160, 80, 25],
                     [170, 90, 30],
                     [180, 100, 35]])

# Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature
mean = np.mean(features, axis=0)
std_dev = np.std(features, axis=0)

# Normalize the features: (value - mean) / std_dev
normalized_features = (features - mean) / std_dev

print("Normalized Features:")
print(normalized_features)
```

In this example:
- We create a NumPy array `features` representing our dataset.
- We compute the mean and standard deviation for each feature column using `np.mean()` and `np.std()`.
- We then normalize the features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

This normalization step is crucial as it ensures that all features contribute equally to the result, which can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

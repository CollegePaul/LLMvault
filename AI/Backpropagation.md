### Understanding Backpropagation in AI

Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm used in training artificial neural networks, particularly feedforward neural networks. It stands for "backward propagation of errors" and plays a crucial role in the learning process by adjusting the weights of the network to minimize prediction error.

Hereâ€™s how backpropagation works:

1. **Forward Pass**: The input data is passed through the network, layer by layer, until it reaches the output layer. This step computes the predicted output based on the current weights and biases of the network.

2. **Compute Loss**: The difference between the predicted output and the actual target values (also known as ground truth) is calculated using a loss function. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error for regression tasks and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.

3. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**: Starting from the output layer, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by moving backward through the network. This involves applying the chain rule of calculus to propagate the error gradients back to earlier layers.

4. **Update Weights**: Using the computed gradients, the weights and biases are updated in an attempt to reduce the loss. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

### Example in Python

Let's walk through a simple example using Python with the popular machine learning library `TensorFlow` to illustrate backpropagation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate some synthetic data
np.random.seed(0)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1) - 1  # Random input data between -1 and 1
y = X + 0.3 * np.random.randn(100, 1)  # Linear relationship with noise

# Define a simple neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=(1,))
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model using backpropagation
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, verbose=0)

# Print trained weights and biases
print("Trained Weights:", model.layers[0].get_weights()[0])
print("Trained Biases:", model.layers[0].get_weights()[1])

# Plotting the loss over epochs to visualize training progress
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.show()
```

In this example, we create a simple linear regression model with one input feature and one output. We generate some synthetic data that has a linear relationship (with added noise) and train the model using stochastic gradient descent to minimize mean squared error.

The `model.fit()` function handles the forward pass, loss computation, backward pass (backpropagation), and weight updates automatically. After training, we print out the learned weights and biases and plot how the loss decreased over the epochs.

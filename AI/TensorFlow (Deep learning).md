### Understanding TensorFlow in the Field of AI

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google that plays a crucial role in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It provides a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

#### Key Features:
- **Ease of Use:** TensorFlow supports multiple programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc., making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Scalability:** It can scale down to a single CPU or GPU in a workstation, up to thousands of GPUs in data centers and cloud services.
- **Flexibility and Portability:** TensorFlow allows developers to deploy computations to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a C API for programming languages like Python, Java, Go, and others.
- **Comprehensive Tooling:** It includes tools for building machine learning models, deploying them into production, and monitoring their performance.

#### Applications:
TensorFlow is used extensively across various domains such as image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, autonomous driving cars, and more.

### Example: Building a Simple Neural Network with TensorFlow

Let's walk through a simple example of building a neural network using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load and preprocess data
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0  # Normalize the images to [0, 1] range

# Build the model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  # Flatten each 28x28 image into a vector of size 784
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # Add a fully connected layer with 128 units and ReLU activation
    layers.Dropout(0.2),                   # Dropout layer to prevent overfitting
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Output layer with 10 units (one for each digit) and softmax activation
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model on test data
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test,  y_test, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized to a range of [0, 1].
2. **Model Building:** A simple neural network with one hidden layer (fully connected) is created using the Sequential API.
3. **Model Compilation:** The model is compiled specifying the optimizer (`adam`), loss function (`sparse_categorical_crossentropy` for multi-class classification), and evaluation metric (`accuracy`).
4. **Training:** The model is trained on the training dataset for 5 epochs.
5. **Evaluation:** Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset.

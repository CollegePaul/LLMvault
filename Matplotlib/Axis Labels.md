### Axis Labels in Matplotlib

In Matplotlib, axis labels are used to provide context and clarity to the data being visualized on a plot. By labeling the x-axis and y-axis, you can specify what each axis represents, making your plots more informative and easier to understand.

For example, if you are plotting temperature changes over time, you might label the x-axis as "Time (hours)" and the y-axis as "Temperature (°C)". This helps the viewer quickly grasp what data is being displayed on each axis.

Here's a simple example in Python using Matplotlib to demonstrate how to add axis labels:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
time = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
temperature = [20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 26]

# Creating the plot
plt.plot(time, temperature)

# Adding axis labels
plt.xlabel('Time (hours)')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')

# Adding a title for clarity
plt.title('Temperature Changes Over Time')

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

In this example:
- `plt.xlabel()` is used to set the label for the x-axis.
- `plt.ylabel()` is used to set the label for the y-axis.

These functions take a string argument that describes what each axis represents, enhancing the readability of the plot. #Axis Labels #matplotlib

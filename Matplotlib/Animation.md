### Explanation of Animation in Matplotlib

Matplotlib, a widely-used plotting library in Python, provides capabilities to create animations that can be embedded into web pages or saved as video files. The `animation` module in Matplotlib allows you to generate animations by sequentially updating figures.

To create an animation, you typically define an initialization function and an update function. The initialization function sets up the plot's initial state, while the update function modifies the plot with each frame of the animation. You then use a class like `FuncAnimation` from `matplotlib.animation` to tie everything together.

Hereâ€™s a simple example that creates an animation of a sine wave moving across the screen:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

# Set up the figure, axis, and plot element we want to animate
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
xdata, ydata = [], []
ln, = plt.plot([], [], 'ro')

# Initialization function: plot the background of each frame
def init():
    ax.set_xlim(0, 2*np.pi)
    ax.set_ylim(-1, 1)
    return ln,

# Animation function. This is called sequentially
def update(frame):
    xdata.append(frame)
    ydata.append(np.sin(frame))
    ln.set_data(xdata, ydata)
    return ln,

# Call the animator: animate the plot by calling FuncAnimation.
ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 128),
                    init_func=init, blit=True)

plt.show()
```

In this example:
- `fig` and `ax` are initialized to set up the figure and axis for plotting.
- `ln` is a plot object that will be updated in each frame.
- The `init` function sets the limits of the x and y axes.
- The `update` function appends new data points to `xdata` and `ydata`, updates the line's data, and returns it to redraw the plot.

The animation is created by calling `FuncAnimation`, specifying the figure (`fig`), the update function (`update`), frames over which to animate (from 0 to \(2\pi\) in this case), the initialization function (`init`), and whether to use blitting for optimization.

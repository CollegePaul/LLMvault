### State Machines in GameMaker

State machines are a fundamental concept in game development used to manage an object's behavior by defining different states and transitions between them. In GameMaker, state machines can be implemented using scripts or directly within the objects' events. They help organize code logically, making it easier to handle complex behaviors and interactions.

For instance, consider a simple enemy AI that has three states: Idle, Chasing, and Attacking. The enemy will transition from one state to another based on conditions such as proximity to the player or health status.

Here's a basic example using GML:

```gml
// Define constants for states
var STATE_IDLE = 0;
var STATE_CHASING = 1;
var STATE_ATTACKING = 2;

// Initialize state in Create Event
state = STATE_IDLE;

// State machine logic in Step Event
switch (state) {
    case STATE_IDLE:
        if (distance_to_object(obj_Player) < 300) {
            state = STATE_CHASING; // Transition to Chasing when player is close
        }
        break;
    
    case STATE_CHASING:
        move_towards_point(obj_Player.x, obj_Player.y, 4); // Chase the player
        if (distance_to_object(obj_Player) < 100) {
            state = STATE_ATTACKING; // Transition to Attacking when close enough
        }
        break;
    
    case STATE_ATTACKING:
        instance_create_layer(x, y - 32, "Bullets", obj_EnemyBullet); // Attack the player
        if (distance_to_object(obj_Player) > 150 || !instance_exists(obj_Player)) {
            state = STATE_IDLE; // Return to Idle or Chasing when conditions change
        }
        break;
}

```

In this example, the enemy object uses a simple switch-case structure to determine its behavior based on the current state. Transitions between states are controlled by conditional statements that check for specific game conditions.

This approach keeps the code organized and easy to understand, especially as more complex behaviors and interactions need to be managed. #State Machines #GameMaker

### Extensions in GameMaker

Extensions in GameMaker Studio allow developers to integrate external libraries or functionality into their projects. These can range from physics engines, audio processing tools, or even custom functionalities that are not natively available within the standard GameMaker environment.

#### How do Extensions Work?
An extension is essentially a package that includes compiled code (DLLs for Windows, SO files for Linux, etc.), which adds new functions and behaviors to your game. They can also include resources like shaders, scripts, or objects. Once an extension is added to your project, its functionalities become accessible through GameMaker Language (GML).

#### Creating a Simple Extension Example
Let's say you want to create a simple extension that provides a function to double a number.

1. **Create the DLL**: First, write and compile a C++ DLL with the desired functionality.
   ```cpp
   // In your C++ code:
   extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int double_number(int num) {
       return num * 2;
   }
   ```

2. **Package the Extension**: After compiling, create an extension file in GameMaker Studio (`.yy` or `.yyp`) that references this DLL.
   
3. **Add a Function Definition**:
   - In the function definition section of your extension settings, add a new function with the prototype `double_number(int)`.
   - Specify the library name and entry point (function name in DLL).

4. **Use the Extension**: Once added to your project, you can call this function from GML.
   ```gml
   // In any script or event:
   var original = 5;
   var doubled = double_number(original);
   show_debug_message("Original: " + string(original) + ", Doubled: " + string(doubled));
   ```

#### Benefits of Using Extensions
- **Performance**: Access to native code can lead to performance improvements.
- **Functionality**: Extend GameMaker's capabilities beyond what is built-in.
- **Modularity**: Encapsulate functionality into reusable components.

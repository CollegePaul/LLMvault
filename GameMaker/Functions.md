### Functions in GameMaker

In GameMaker Studio 2 (GMS2), functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be reused throughout your game. They help to organize code, make it more readable, and promote reusability by allowing you to encapsulate functionality into named blocks.

#### Types of Functions
1. **Built-in Functions**: These are predefined by GameMaker and provide a wide range of functionalities such as drawing on the screen (`draw_sprite`), playing sounds (`audio_play_sound`), and manipulating data structures.
   
2. **Custom Functions**: Developers can create their own functions to perform specific tasks tailored to their game's needs.

#### Creating Custom Functions
To create a custom function, you use the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses. Here is an example of a simple custom function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

```gml
// Define the function named 'calculate_area' with two parameters: width and height
function calculate_area(width, height) {
    // Return the product of width and height
    return width * height;
}
```

#### Using Custom Functions
Once defined, you can call this function from anywhere in your game code. Hereâ€™s how you might use it within a step event to calculate and display the area:

```gml
// Define variables for width and height
var rect_width = 10;
var rect_height = 5;

// Call the 'calculate_area' function with rect_width and rect_height as arguments
var area = calculate_area(rect_width, rect_height);

// Draw the result on the screen
draw_text(32, 32, "The area of the rectangle is: " + string(area));
```

In this example, `calculate_area` is a custom function that takes two parameters (`width` and `height`) and returns their product. The result is then used in a step event to display the calculated area on the screen.

#### Benefits
- **Reusability**: Functions can be reused multiple times throughout your game.
- **Maintainability**: Changes made to functions are reflected wherever they're called, making it easier to maintain large codebases.
- **Modularity**: Functions allow for modular programming, breaking down complex tasks into simpler, manageable pieces.

### Quaternions in GameMaker

Quaternions are mathematical entities that extend complex numbers to four dimensions (one real part and three imaginary parts). They are particularly useful in 3D computer graphics, robotics, and control theory for representing rotations without suffering from issues like gimbal lock. In GameMaker Studio (GMS), quaternions can be utilized to smoothly interpolate between orientations and apply complex rotations.

In GMS2, you can work with quaternions using the DSQuat functions available in the DS Maths module. This module provides a set of functions that allow you to create, manipulate, and convert quaternions.

#### Creating a Quaternion

To create a quaternion from Euler angles (pitch, yaw, roll):

```gml
var pitch = deg2rad(30); // 30 degrees in radians
var yaw = deg2rad(45);
var roll = deg2rad(60);

var q = ds_quat_create(pitch, yaw, roll);
```

#### Applying a Quaternion to an Object

To apply the quaternion rotation to an object:

```gml
// Assuming obj_player is your player object and q is the quaternion
ds_quat_apply(q, obj_player.x, obj_player.y, obj_player.z, id);
```

#### Slerping Between Quaternions

Spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) is a method of interpolating between two quaternions to create a smooth rotation:

```gml
var q1 = ds_quat_create(deg2rad(0), deg2rad(90), deg2rad(0));
var q2 = ds_quat_create(deg2rad(0), deg2rad(-90), deg2rad(0));

var t = 0.5; // Interpolation factor (between 0 and 1)

var q_slerp = ds_quat_slerp(q1, q2, t);

// Apply the interpolated quaternion
ds_quat_apply(q_slerp, obj_player.x, obj_player.y, obj_player.z, id);
```

Quaternions are powerful tools for handling rotations in 3D space, providing smooth and efficient transformations. Understanding how to use them can greatly enhance your game's physics and animation systems.

### Asynchronous Events in GameMaker

Asynchronous events in GameMaker refer to events that occur independently of the game's main loop, allowing your game to handle external data or perform actions without freezing or disrupting gameplay. These events are particularly useful for tasks like loading assets, receiving network data, or handling file operations.

Some common types of asynchronous events include:
- **Async Load Event**: Triggered when an asset (like a sprite, sound, or room) has finished loading asynchronously.
- **Async Network Event**: Triggered when there is incoming data from a network connection.
- **Async HTTP Event**: Triggered after receiving a response to an HTTP request.

#### Example: Async Load Event

Suppose you want to load a large sprite asynchronously without pausing the game. You can use the `asset_load` function to start loading and then handle the completion in the `Async Load` event.

```gml
// In Create Event of an object
var sprite_id = asset_get_index("spr_large_sprite");
asset_load(sprite_id);
```

In the Async Load Event, you would check if the asset has been loaded successfully:

```gml
if (async_load_status == ds_map)
{
    var success = ds_map_find_value(async_load, "status") == 0;
    if (success)
    {
        var sprite_index = ds_map_find_value(async_load, "id");
        // Use the sprite_index as needed, for example, assign it to an object
        obj_myobject.sprite_index = sprite_index;
    }
}
```

This way, the game can continue running smoothly while the large sprite is being loaded in the background.

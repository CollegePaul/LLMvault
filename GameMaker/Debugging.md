### Debugging in GameMaker

Debugging in GameMaker Studio involves identifying and resolving issues within your game's code to ensure smooth functionality and performance. The process often includes checking for syntax errors, logical mistakes, or unexpected behaviors that can hinder the gameplay experience.

One common method of debugging is using the `show_debug_message()` function, which outputs messages to the console during runtime. This allows developers to track the values of variables, check if certain conditions are met, and understand the flow of their game logic. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```gml
// Example of using show_debug_message() for debugging
var player_health = 100;

if (player_health > 50) {
    show_debug_message("Player health is above 50");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Player health is 50 or below");
}
```

In this code snippet, a message will appear in the console indicating whether the player's health is above 50 or not. This can help you verify that your conditional logic is working as expected.

Another useful technique is utilizing breakpoints within the IDE. Breakpoints allow you to pause the game at specific lines of code so you can inspect variables and step through the execution process line by line, helping to pinpoint where things might be going wrong.

For example:

```gml
// Example of using a breakpoint for debugging
var player_position = (x, y);
show_debug_message("Current player position: " + string(player_x) + ", " + string(player_y));

// Place a breakpoint on the line below to inspect variable values at runtime
if (player_position.x > room_width / 2) {
    show_debug_message("Player is on the right side of the screen");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Player is on the left side of the screen");
}
```

By setting breakpoints and examining the console output, you can gain a deeper understanding of your game's behavior and make necessary adjustments to fix any issues.

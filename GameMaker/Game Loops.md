### Game Loops in GameMaker

In GameMaker, a game loop is the central mechanism that drives the continuous updating and rendering of your game. It ensures that all game logic, such as player input handling, physics calculations, and object updates, are processed smoothly at a consistent frame rate.

The main game loop in GameMaker is automatically managed by the engine, but developers can control specific aspects of it using event-driven programming. This means that you write code to respond to different events like step events (every frame), draw events (rendering frames), and keyboard/mouse input events.

For example, consider a simple scenario where you want an object to move across the screen based on player input:

```gml
// Inside the Step Event of your object

// Check if the right arrow key is pressed
if (keyboard_check(vk_right))
{
    // Move the object to the right by 5 pixels per frame
    x += 5;
}

// Check if the left arrow key is pressed
if (keyboard_check(vk_left))
{
    // Move the object to the left by 5 pixels per frame
    x -= 5;
}
```

In this code snippet, the logic inside the step event gets executed every frame of the game loop. The `keyboard_check` function checks if a key is being pressed, and based on that input, it modifies the position of the object (`x`).

Similarly, you can handle other types of events to create complex behaviors and interactions in your game.

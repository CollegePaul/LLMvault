### Memory Management in C++

Memory management in C++ involves controlling how memory is allocated and deallocated during the runtime of a program. This is crucial because C++ provides low-level access to system memory, which allows for high performance but also requires careful handling to avoid issues like memory leaks, buffer overflows, and dangling pointers.

C++ uses two primary regions of memory:
1. **Stack**: Automatically managed by the compiler, where function call frames are stored. Memory allocation and deallocation happen automatically when functions are called or return.
2. **Heap**: Manually managed by the programmer using operators like `new` for dynamic memory allocation and `delete` for deallocation.

Here’s a brief overview of how these work:
- **Stack Allocation** is fast but has limited size, determined at compile time.
  ```cpp
  int a = 10; // Stack allocated
  ```
- **Heap Allocation** allows for more flexible memory management with larger sizes but requires manual control to avoid memory leaks.
  ```cpp
  int* b = new int(20); // Heap allocated
  delete b;             // Manual deallocation
  ```

### Python Comparison

Python handles memory management automatically through a garbage collector, which means you do not need to manually allocate or deallocate memory. This simplifies the programming process but can lead to less control over performance and memory usage.

Here’s an example in Python:
```python
# Stack-like allocation (automatic)
a = 10

# Heap allocation (automatic), managed by garbage collector
b = [20] * 1000  # List of 1000 integers, allocated on the heap
```

In the above Python example, you do not need to worry about allocating or deallocating memory explicitly. The list `b` is dynamically created and will be automatically cleaned up by Python's garbage collector when it is no longer in use.

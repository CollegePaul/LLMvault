### Arrays in C++

An array in C++ is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to represent data that consists of a sequence of similar values, such as a list of student scores or a set of temperatures over a week.

#### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

To declare an array in C++, you specify the type of its elements, followed by the name of the array, and then specify the number of elements it can hold within square brackets. Here is an example:

```cpp
int numbers[5]; // Declares an array named 'numbers' that can store 5 integers
```

You can also initialize arrays at the time of declaration:

```cpp
int scores[] = {85, 92, 78, 88, 90}; // Initializes an array with 5 integer values
```

#### Accessing Array Elements

Array elements in C++ are accessed using their index, which starts from 0. Here’s how you can access and modify elements:

```cpp
int firstScore = scores[0]; // Accesses the first element of the 'scores' array
scores[1] = 95;             // Modifies the second element of the 'scores' array to 95
```

#### Example Using Python

In Python, lists are used similarly to arrays in C++. Here’s how you can declare and initialize a list:

```python
numbers = [0] * 5  # Creates a list named 'numbers' with 5 elements all set to 0
scores = [85, 92, 78, 88, 90]  # Initializes a list with 5 integer values
```

Accessing and modifying elements in a Python list is very similar:

```python
first_score = scores[0]  # Accesses the first element of the 'scores' list
scores[1] = 95           # Modifies the second element of the 'scores' list to 95
```

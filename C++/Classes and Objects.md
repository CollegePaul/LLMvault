### Classes and Objects in C++

In C++, classes are user-defined data types that encapsulate data and functions together. They allow you to create blueprints for objects, which can contain attributes (data members) and methods (member functions). An object is an instance of a class, meaning it is a specific realization of the class with actual values assigned to its attributes.

Here’s how you might define a simple class in C++:

```cpp
class Car {
private:
    int speed;
public:
    void setSpeed(int s) {
        speed = s;
    }
    int getSpeed() const {
        return speed;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;  // Creating an object of the class Car
    myCar.setSpeed(100);
    std::cout << "The car's speed is: " << myCar.getSpeed() << " km/h" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- `Car` is a class with a private data member `speed`.
- It has public methods `setSpeed` and `getSpeed` to modify and access the `speed` attribute.
- In the `main` function, an object `myCar` of type `Car` is created, and its speed is set and retrieved.

### Classes and Objects in Python

In Python, classes are used similarly to define new data types that can contain both data (attributes) and methods. Here’s how you might achieve similar functionality as the C++ example using Python:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.speed = 0

    def set_speed(self, s):
        self.speed = s

    def get_speed(self):
        return self.speed

# Creating an object of the class Car
my_car = Car()
my_car.set_speed(100)
print(f"The car's speed is: {my_car.get_speed()} km/h")
```

In this Python example:
- `Car` is a class with an attribute `speed`.
- The `__init__` method initializes the `speed` attribute.
- Methods `set_speed` and `get_speed` are used to modify and access the `speed` attribute.
- An object `my_car` of type `Car` is created, its speed is set, and then printed.

### Functions in C++
In C++, functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be reused throughout a program. They help in organizing the code into manageable sections, making it easier to understand and maintain. Functions can take inputs as parameters and return outputs after processing.

A function in C++ consists of three main parts:
1. **Function Declaration**: This tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. It is also known as a function prototype.
2. **Function Definition**: This is where the actual code for the function resides, detailing what the function does.
3. **Function Call**: This is when you use the function in your program to perform a task.

Hereâ€™s an example of how functions work in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function declaration
int add(int num1, int num2);

int main() {
    // Function call
    int result = add(5, 3);
    cout << "The sum is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
```

### Equivalent in Python

In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword. They can also take parameters and return values. Here's how you could write an equivalent function in Python:

```python
# Function definition
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Function call
    result = add(5, 3)
    print("The sum is:", result)
```

In the Python example:
- The `add` function is defined to take two parameters (`num1` and `num2`) and returns their sum.
- In the main block of the program, the function is called with arguments `5` and `3`, and the result is printed.

Both C++ and Python use functions to encapsulate functionality, promoting code reuse and modularity. #Functions #cpp

### Virtual Functions in C++

Virtual functions are a key feature in C++ that enable polymorphism, allowing a base class to define a virtual function that can be overridden by derived classes. When you call the virtual function through a pointer or reference to the base class, the most derived version of the function is called. This mechanism is crucial for achieving dynamic method binding.

Here’s a simple example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() const {
        std::cout << "Some generic animal sound" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() const override {
        std::cout << "Woof!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() const override {
        std::cout << "Meow!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;

    Dog dog;
    Cat cat;

    animalPtr = &dog;
    animalPtr->speak();  // Outputs: Woof!

    animalPtr = &cat;
    animalPtr->speak();  // Outputs: Meow!

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Animal` class has a virtual function `speak()`. The `Dog` and `Cat` classes override this function. When `speak()` is called through an `Animal*`, the correct overridden version is executed based on the actual object type.

### Example in Python

Python does not have virtual functions or method overriding in the same way as C++. However, Python supports dynamic dispatch of methods using inheritance and polymorphism. Here’s a similar example:

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow!")

def main():
    animal_list = [Dog(), Cat()]

    for animal in animal_list:
        animal.speak()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python example, `speak()` is a method defined in the base class `Animal`. The derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` provide their own implementations of `speak()`. When calling `speak()` on an instance of these classes, the appropriate method for the object’s type is invoked.

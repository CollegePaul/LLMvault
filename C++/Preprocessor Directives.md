### Preprocessor Directives in C++

Preprocessor directives are special instructions that the preprocessor understands and processes before the actual compilation begins. These directives start with a hash symbol (`#`) and perform tasks like including header files, defining constants or macros, conditional compilation, etc.

#### Common Preprocessor Directives:

1. **`#include`**: This directive is used to include the contents of a file into the source code.
   - Example in C++:
     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>  // Includes the standard input-output stream library
     ```

2. **`#define`**: This directive is used to define constants or macros.
   - Example in C++:
     ```cpp
     #define PI 3.14159
     double area = PI * radius * radius;  // Uses the macro PI
     ```

3. **`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#endif`**: These directives are used for conditional compilation.
   - Example in C++:
     ```cpp
     #define DEBUG
     #ifdef DEBUG
         std::cout << "Debug mode is on." << std::endl;
     #else
         std::cout << "Debug mode is off." << std::endl;
     #endif
     ```

4. **`#pragma`**: This directive provides special compiler instructions.
   - Example in C++:
     ```cpp
     #pragma once  // Ensures the file is included only once
     ```

#### Equivalent Concepts in Python:

While Python does not have a direct equivalent to preprocessor directives, some of their functionalities can be achieved using other mechanisms.

- **Including Files**: In Python, you use `import` statements.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import math  # Includes the math module
    ```

- **Defining Constants**: In Python, constants are typically defined as variables with uppercase names.
  - Example:
    ```python
    PI = 3.14159
    area = PI * radius * radius  # Uses the constant PI
    ```

- **Conditional Compilation**: Python uses `if` statements for conditional logic.
  - Example:
    ```python
    DEBUG = True
    if DEBUG:
        print("Debug mode is on.")
    else:
        print("Debug mode is off.")
    ```

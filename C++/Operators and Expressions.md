### Operators and Expressions in C++

In C++, operators are symbols that perform operations on operands, which can be variables or values. Operators help in forming expressions, which combine these elements to produce results.

#### Types of Operators in C++
1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for basic mathematical calculations.
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulus)

2. **Assignment Operators**: Assign values to variables.
   - `=` (Simple Assignment)
   - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` (Compound Assignment)

3. **Comparison Operators**: Compare two values and return a boolean result.
   - `==` (Equal to)
   - `!=` (Not equal to)
   - `<`, `>` (Less than, Greater than)
   - `<=`, `>=` (Less than or equal to, Greater than or equal to)

4. **Logical Operators**: Used for combining boolean values.
   - `&&` (Logical AND)
   - `||` (Logical OR)
   - `!` (Logical NOT)

5. **Bitwise Operators**: Perform operations at the bit level.
   - `&` (Bitwise AND)
   - `|` (Bitwise OR)
   - `^` (Bitwise XOR)
   - `~` (Bitwise NOT)
   - `<<` (Left Shift)
   - `>>` (Right Shift)

6. **Increment and Decrement Operators**: Increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.
   - `++` (Pre-increment, Post-increment)
   - `--` (Pre-decrement, Post-decrement)

7. **Conditional Operator**: Ternary operator that returns one of two values based on a condition.
   - `condition ? expr1 : expr2`

8. **Comma Operator**: Evaluates both expressions and returns the value of the second expression.
   - `expr1, expr2`

#### Example in C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 3;
    
    cout << "a + b: " << (a + b) << endl; // Addition
    cout << "a - b: " << (a - b) << endl; // Subtraction
    cout << "a * b: " << (a * b) << endl; // Multiplication
    cout << "a / b: " << (a / b) << endl; // Division
    cout << "a % b: " << (a % b) << endl; // Modulus

    a += 2;
    cout << "After a += 2, a = " << a << endl;

    bool isEqual = (a == b);
    cout << "Is a equal to b? " << isEqual << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Equivalent Example in Python
Python has similar operators with slightly different syntax and capabilities.

```python
# Arithmetic Operators
a = 5
b = 3
print("a + b:", a + b)  # Addition
print("a - b:", a - b)  # Subtraction
print("a * b:", a * b)  # Multiplication
print("a / b:", a / b)  # Division (floating-point)
print("a % b:", a % b)  # Modulus

# Assignment Operators
a += 2
print("After a += 2, a =", a)

# Comparison Operators
is_equal = (a == b)
print("Is a equal to b?", is_equal)

# Logical Operators
c = True
d = False
print("c and d:", c and d)  # Logical AND
print("c or d:", c or d)    # Logical OR
print("not d:", not d)      # Logical NOT

# Bitwise Operators (similar to C++)
e = 0b1100
f = 0b1010
print("Bitwise AND:", e & f)
print("Bitwise OR:", e | f)
print("Bitwise XOR:", e ^ f)
print("Left Shift:", e << 2)
print("Right Shift:", e >> 2)

# Conditional Operator (similar to ternary operator in C++)
result = "Equal" if a == b else "Not Equal"
print(result)

# Comma Operator (not commonly used in Python, but can be seen in loops and function calls)
x, y = 10, 20
print(x, y)
```

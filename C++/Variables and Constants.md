### Variables and Constants in C++

In C++, variables are used to store data that can change during program execution, while constants represent fixed values that do not change. 

#### Declaring Variables:
To declare a variable in C++, you specify the data type followed by the variable name. For example:

```cpp
int number;          // declares an integer variable named 'number'
double pi = 3.14159; // declares a double variable named 'pi' and initializes it with 3.14159
char initial = 'A';  // declares a character variable named 'initial' and initializes it with 'A'
```

#### Declaring Constants:
Constants can be declared using the `const` keyword or by defining them as macros, but the `const` keyword is preferred in modern C++ because it is type-safe. Hereâ€™s how to declare constants:

```cpp
const int maxSize = 100; // declares a constant integer named 'maxSize' with value 100
```

### Variables and Constants in Python

In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to specify the data type explicitly. You simply assign a value to a variable name:

```python
number = 42          # creates a variable named 'number' and assigns it the integer 42
pi = 3.14159         # creates a variable named 'pi' and assigns it the float 3.14159
initial = 'A'        # creates a variable named 'initial' and assigns it the character 'A'
```

#### Constants in Python:
Python does not have built-in support for constants, but by convention, developers use all uppercase letters to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. For example:

```python
MAX_SIZE = 100       # this is a constant named MAX_SIZE with value 100
```

It's important to note that Python does not enforce immutability for these constants, but the convention helps communicate intent.

### Operator Overloading in C++

Operator overloading in C++ allows you to redefine or overload operators so that they can work with user-defined types like classes. This means you can specify what happens when an operator is used with objects of your class, making code more intuitive and easier to understand.

For example, consider a class `Vector2D` representing a 2-dimensional vector. Normally, the addition operator (`+`) cannot be used directly between two `Vector2D` objects. However, by overloading the `+` operator, you can define how two vectors should be added together, element-wise.

Here's a simple example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Vector2D {
private:
    double x, y;

public:
    Vector2D(double x = 0.0, double y = 0.0) : x(x), y(y) {}

    // Overloading the + operator
    Vector2D operator+(const Vector2D& other) const {
        return Vector2D(x + other.x, y + other.y);
    }

    void print() const {
        std::cout << "Vector(" << x << ", " << y << ")" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Vector2D v1(3.0, 4.0);
    Vector2D v2(5.0, 6.0);

    Vector2D result = v1 + v2; // Uses the overloaded + operator

    result.print(); // Outputs: Vector(8, 10)

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `+` operator is overloaded to add two `Vector2D` objects by adding their respective components.

### Equivalent Example in Python

Python does not support operator overloading in the same way C++ does, but it provides special methods (often called "dunder" methods) that allow similar functionality. These methods start and end with double underscores (`__`). For example, to overload the `+` operator, you can define the `__add__` method.

Here's how you might implement a similar `Vector2D` class in Python:

```python
class Vector2D:
    def __init__(self, x=0.0, y=0.0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    # Overloading the + operator
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector2D(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

# Usage
v1 = Vector2D(3.0, 4.0)
v2 = Vector2D(5.0, 6.0)

result = v1 + v2  # Uses the overloaded __add__ method

print(result)  # Outputs: Vector(8.0, 10.0)
```

In this Python example, the `__add__` method is defined to handle addition of two `Vector2D` objects.

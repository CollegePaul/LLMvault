### Dynamic Allocation in C++

Dynamic allocation in C++ refers to the process of allocating memory at runtime rather than compile time. This allows programs to manage memory more flexibly, especially when the size of data structures or the amount of required memory isn't known until the program is running.

In C++, dynamic memory allocation is primarily done using the `new` and `delete` operators. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **`new` Operator**: This operator allocates memory for a variable or an array of variables on the heap (free store) and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
- **`delete` Operator**: This operator frees the memory previously allocated with `new`. It is crucial to use `delete` to release memory when it is no longer needed, to prevent memory leaks.

#### Example in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Allocate memory for an integer on the heap
    int* ptr = new int;
    
    *ptr = 10;  // Assign a value to the allocated memory
    
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr << std::endl;
    
    // Free the allocated memory
    delete ptr;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `new int` allocates enough space for an integer on the heap and returns a pointer to that space. The value `10` is then assigned to that location, and finally, `delete ptr` releases the memory.

#### Example in Python

Python handles memory management automatically through its garbage collector, so explicit dynamic allocation as seen in C++ with `new` and `delete` isn't necessary. However, you can simulate a similar concept using classes or lists if needed:

```python
class DynamicArray:
    def __init__(self):
        self.array = []
    
    def add(self, value):
        self.array.append(value)
    
    def remove(self):
        if self.array:
            return self.array.pop()
        else:
            return None

# Usage of the dynamic array class
dynamic_array = DynamicArray()
dynamic_array.add(10)
print("Value:", dynamic_array.remove())
```

In this Python example, a simple `DynamicArray` class is used to manage a list dynamically. Elements can be added and removed from this list at runtime, similar to how you might manage memory in C++ with dynamic allocation.

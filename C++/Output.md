### Explanation of Output in C++

In C++, outputting data to the console or other standard output streams is typically handled using the `std::cout` object, which is part of the Standard Template Library (STL). The `std::cout` object is used in conjunction with the insertion operator (`<<`) to send data to the output stream. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::cout` is used to print the string `"Hello, World!"` to the console. The `<<` operator inserts the string into the output stream. The `std::endl` manipulator not only inserts a newline character but also flushes the buffer.

For more complex data types such as integers or floating-point numbers, you can insert them directly using the same operator:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number = 42;
    double pi = 3.14159;

    std::cout << "Number: " << number << ", Pi: " << pi << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Equivalent in Python

In Python, outputting data is handled using the `print()` function. This function takes one or more arguments and prints them to the console separated by spaces by default. Here's how you can achieve similar functionality:

```python
# Basic string output
print("Hello, World!")

# Output with multiple values
number = 42
pi = 3.14159

print("Number:", number, ", Pi:", pi)
```

In this Python example, the `print()` function is used to display strings and variables on the console. The output will be formatted as specified in the arguments passed to `print()`.

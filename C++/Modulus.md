### Explanation of Modulus in C++

The modulus operator in C++, denoted by `%`, is used to find the remainder of a division operation between two integers. When you perform `a % b`, it returns the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. This operator is particularly useful for tasks like checking if one number is divisible by another, or cycling through a range of numbers.

**Example Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 3;

    // Using modulus to find the remainder
    int result = num1 % num2;
    
    std::cout << "The remainder of " << num1 << " divided by " << num2 << " is: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `num1` is divided by `num2`, and the modulus operator `%` calculates that the remainder is `1`. The output will be:
```
The remainder of 10 divided by 3 is: 1
```

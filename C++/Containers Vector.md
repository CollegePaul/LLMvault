### Explanation of Containers: Vector in C++

In C++, a `std::vector` is a dynamic array that can resize itself automatically when elements are added or removed. It is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and provides functionalities to add, remove, and access elements efficiently.

A vector maintains the order of its elements and allows fast random access using indices, similar to arrays. However, unlike static arrays, vectors can grow and shrink in size dynamically as needed. This makes `std::vector` a very flexible container for managing collections of elements.

Key operations with vectors include:
- **Adding Elements**: You can add elements at the end of the vector using the `push_back()` method.
- **Removing Elements**: Elements can be removed from the end using `pop_back()`, or you can erase specific elements using iterators.
- **Accessing Elements**: Elements can be accessed using the subscript operator `[]` or the `at()` method, which also performs bounds checking.

Here is a simple example in C++ demonstrating some of these operations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec; // Create an empty vector of integers

    vec.push_back(10);  // Add elements to the vector
    vec.push_back(20);
    vec.push_back(30);

    std::cout << "Element at index 1: " << vec.at(1) << std::endl;

    vec.pop_back();     // Remove the last element

    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << "Element at index " << i << ": " << vec[i] << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Python Equivalent Example

While Python does not have a direct equivalent to `std::vector` in terms of dynamic array capabilities, lists serve a similar purpose. Lists in Python can dynamically grow and shrink as elements are added or removed.

Here is how you might perform similar operations using Python lists:

```python
# Create an empty list
vec = []

# Add elements to the list
vec.append(10)
vec.append(20)
vec.append(30)

print("Element at index 1:", vec[1])

# Remove the last element
vec.pop()

for i in range(len(vec)):
    print(f"Element at index {i}: {vec[i]}")
```

In this Python example, `append()` is used to add elements, `pop()` removes the last element, and list indexing (`[]`) provides access to individual elements.

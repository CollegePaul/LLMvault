### Class Members in C++
In C++, class members refer to variables and functions that are defined within a class. These can be categorized into two main types: member variables and member functions.

**Member Variables**: Also known as data members, these are the variables declared within a class. They hold the state of objects created from the class. Member variables can be accessed by object instances and can have different access specifiers such as `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

Example in C++:
```cpp
class Car {
public:
    int year; // public member variable
private:
    std::string model; // private member variable
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.year = 2021; // Accessible because it is public
    // myCar.model = "Sedan"; // Not accessible because it is private
}
```

**Member Functions**: These are functions that operate on the data of objects. They can manipulate member variables and other functions of the class. Like member variables, they can also have different access specifiers.

Example in C++:
```cpp
class Car {
private:
    int year;
public:
    void setYear(int y) { // member function to set the value of year
        year = y;
    }
    int getYear() { // member function to get the value of year
        return year;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.setYear(2021);
    std::cout << "Car year: " << myCar.getYear(); // Outputs: Car year: 2021
}
```

While C++ and Python are different languages, we can draw some parallels in Python using classes.

**Python Equivalent**:
In Python, class members are also divided into instance variables (similar to member variables) and methods (similar to member functions). In Python, all members of a class are public by default unless they are prefixed with double underscores.

Example in Python:
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.year = None  # Instance variable

    def set_year(self, y):  # Method to set the value of year
        self.year = y

    def get_year(self):  # Method to get the value of year
        return self.year

my_car = Car()
my_car.set_year(2021)
print("Car year:", my_car.get_year())  # Outputs: Car year: 2021
```

In this Python example, `year` is an instance variable (similar to a member variable in C++), and `set_year` and `get_year` are methods (similar to member functions).

### Iterators in C++

In C++, iterators are used to traverse elements in containers such as vectors, lists, maps, etc. An iterator acts like a pointer that points to an element within the container and allows you to access or modify the element at that position. They provide a way to abstract away the details of accessing elements from different types of containers, making your code more generic and reusable.

There are several types of iterators in C++:
- **Input Iterator**: Allows reading elements sequentially.
- **Output Iterator**: Allows writing elements sequentially.
- **Forward Iterator**: Can read or write elements sequentially and can iterate over a range multiple times.
- **Bidirectional Iterator**: Supports forward and backward traversal.
- **Random Access Iterator**: Allows random access to any element, similar to array indices.

Here’s an example of using iterators in C++ with the `std::vector` container:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Using iterator to print all elements of vector
    for (std::vector<int>::iterator it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `vec.begin()` returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the vector, and `vec.end()` returns an iterator pointing just past the last element. The loop increments the iterator until it reaches `vec.end()`, printing each element along the way.

### Example in Python

While Python does not have explicit iterators like C++, you can achieve similar functionality using iterators from the `itertools` module or by using standard iteration mechanisms.

Here’s an example using a list and a for loop, which internally uses an iterator:

```python
# Example using a simple for loop to iterate over a list in Python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

for number in numbers:
    print(number, end=" ")
print()
```

In this example, the `for` loop automatically uses an iterator to traverse the elements of the list.
